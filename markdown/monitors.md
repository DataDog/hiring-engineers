All the data we've collected so far is nice to look at, but what if you need to respond to a metric that goes outside of some bounds by, say, restarting a server? It would be nice to have an alerting mechanism around this. Luckily Datadog provides this via Monitors.

# Monitors

Monitors are your gateway to making the metrics about your infrastructure actionable by alerting you when certain things happen in your infrstructure. As an example of setting up a monitor, lets create a new Metric Monitor that watches the average of your custom metric (my_metric) and will if itâ€™s above 800 over the past 5 minutes and send a warning if it's above 500 for the past 5 minutes. We'll also set up an alert when no data is received for 10 minutes.

We'll start by navigating to the Monitor screen by going to `Manage Monitors`:

![Manage Monitors](../images/new_monitor.png)

At the top right you'll see a big blue `New Monitor` button.* Go ahead and click that to go to the Monitor Selection page. There's a whole menagerie of [Monitor types](https://docs.datadoghq.com/monitors/) to choose from but I'll focus on the Metric Monitor. Go ahead and select the Metric monitor to start creating an alert.

This will bring you to the alert page where you can configure your alert. Let's walk through each part. First we need to choose the detection method. For our goals of alerting and warning above certain values, we can just use the basic `Threshold Alert`. Here we'll set the `Alert threshold` to `800` and the `Warning threshold` to `500`. And before we leave this part of the page, make sure to set the drop down setting for missing data to `Notify` (the default is `Do not notify`) and set the lookback window to 10 minutes.

In the next section (labeled `#4 Say what's happening`) we can define who will be alerted under the various conditions. We'll also send different messages based on whether the monitor is in an Alert, Warning, or in the No Data state and include the metric value that caused the monitor to trigger and host ip when the Monitor triggers an Alert state for easy troubleshooting. There are lots of conditional variables to use and you can learn more about the conditional formatting by clicking the question mark next to `Use message template variables`. For now we'll just use the `#is_alert`, `#is_warning` and `#is_no_data` variables.

And lastly, we can define who will be notified when the alerts (and other states) are triggered.

Before we go let's test our notifications to see what they look like when they're triggered. At the very bottom of the Monitor page, before you `Save` or `Cancel`, you can click the `Test Notifications` button that will bring up a prompt asking you for which states you want to have sent out.

After you click the `Run Test` button, go to your inbox associated with the email address you configured for your account. You should see somnething like the screenshots below.

Triggered Alert:

Triggered Warning:

![Warn](../images/test_warn.png)

Triggered No Data:

One last bonus tip: since this alert is goign to be pretty noisy (and literally random) let's set up some scheduled downtimes for 7pm to 9am daily on M-F and all day on Sat-Sun. You may have already noticed that the place to schedule the downtime for your alerts is in the same place that you set the alerts up, under Monitor.

![scheduled](../images/downtime.png)

Once you get into the downtime scheduling page, you'll set up two downtimes that look like the below:

Weekday Downtime:

![weekday](../images/weekday_downtime.png)

Weekend Downtime:

![weekend](../images/weekend_downtime.png)

Once you schedule your downtime, you should get an email confirmation that looks like the below:

*The astute reader will notice that you can go directly to the New Monitor page by selecting 'New Monitor' from the drop down/pull out menu instead 'Manage Monitor'. You get extra points for saving a click.
