Well that was a lot of fun! We took a really quick tour of Datadog's functionality. We covered a lot of ground in a very short amount of time so now might be a good time to checkout [the very excellent documenation](https://docs.datadoghq.com) that Datadog offers.

First we saw how to prepare your infrastructure for monitoring through [the use of tags](./collecting_metrics.com). We then saw how to use the tags we set up to [visualize the data](./collectig_metrics.md) and then set up [alerting on the data via monitors](./monitors.md) to be notified when something out of the ordinary happens.

Finally we looked at Datadog [Application Performance Monitoring (APM) offering](./apm_page.md) where we saw how to do some basic tracing of an application with minimal instrumentation. 

# Conclusion

Datadog is an infrastucture and application monitoring platform and so much more. Beyond all things discussed previously, you can collect, visualize and monitor any data that you can pull into Datadog.

I hope this brief introduction has whet your appetite to learn more! If you have any further questions or are interested in upgrading your access to Datadog, don't hesitate to email me at ramy.abdelazim@datadoghq.com and I'd be happy to help!
