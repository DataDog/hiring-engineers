# Applying Datadog (Final Question)

### Answer the question: What else can we use DataDog on?

Datadog is widely-used as an IT infrastructure monitoring service. We can expand Datadog as a service for Internet of Things (IoT).

For example, Datadog should partner with makers of vending machines. Vending machines all-over Japan and the world would be sending metrics on the current status and health of the vending machines. Using this information, owners of vending machine would know when to fill-up the machine and when to do maintenance work.

Another example is integration with coffee machines. Using datadog, we can know if a coffee machine is currently in use or if someone is cleaning it at the moment. This way, we can schedule our coffee breaks more efficiently.

I think the next integrations of Datadog would be for supporting IoT.
