ANSWER #10:

Brief Explanation:
When I'm spotting some issues or anomaly within any time period, I can simply zooming into time series data.
Datadog metrics are stored with 1 second granularity, I will not miss any problem spot.
Next, I can annotate the graph and send email. I'm not going to lose my important evidence.

Steps:
- Highlight the graph and drag it to get 5 minutes coverage (annwer-task10-pic1.png)
- CLick on the graph and select annotate (annwer-task10-pic2.png)
