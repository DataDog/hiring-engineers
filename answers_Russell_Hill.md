# Prerequisites - Setup the environment
You can utilize any OS/host that you would like to complete this exercise. 
>Answer I am using both the Ubuntu via Vagrant and a Windows agent on my laptop so I can see the differences in setup and user experience.

>I am impressed how easy this is with a single command

>The Windows agent was also very simple with a quick setup wizard asking for the API string. I think it is great that with this API your agents report straight into the correct place. Other tools I have used have taken a lot more messing around to get the agents reporting in to the correct place. Some require DNS entries which can delay installs and need to include change control etc.

# Collecting Metrics:
* Add tags in the Agent config file and show us a screenshot of your host and its tags on the Host Map page in Datadog.
>Answer I was having issues with the Ubuntu agent getting to the datadog.yaml to edit with permission denied and I was using a new laptop at home so a lot of settings weren't playing ball with the VM terminal, so I switched to the Windows agent editor and this was much quicker and very easy to use. This is often the best way to work around issues while onsite with customers. You can spend time and resolve the issue at a later date but getting things moving along within the time allotted is often best for the customer.

>here are the tags from the hostmap screen

* Install a database on your machine (MongoDB, MySQL, or PostgreSQL) and then install the respective Datadog integration for that database.

>I have installed MongoDB on my Windows machine. I created the user on mongodb

>I added a mongo check on the agent

>and Mongo info is now on the host dashboard!üòÅ

* Create a custom Agent check that submits a metric named my_metric with a random value between 0 and 1000.
* Change your check's collection interval so that it only submits the metric once every 45 seconds.
* Bonus Question Can you change the collection interval without modifying the Python check file you created?
>For all of the above points, I am no coder but I did find a very useful link on who all of this is done
https://docs.datadoghq.com/developers/agent_checks/
>This seems fairly straight forward for someone with coding skills but as it would take me a long time to run through it learning as I went I have left this for another time (should you give me the opportunity to get learning from within DataDog üòâ)

# Visualizing Data:

>Here I can see the previous sections needs to be done and further scripting so I have instead used this time to have a play with dashboards, creating graphs, alerts and generally looking around.

>I found that the dashboards look great and can easily be edited and clone for any user or view required. One thing that my previous employers product always struggled with was making their creat dashboards so easily customisable and also work on big screen which are commonly used in NOCs and SOCs.

>I also saw how easy it was to create alerts from items you see in graphs from dashboards. I picked one and had an alert running in no time.

<img src="https://github.com/Rusk-Hill/Datadogscreenshots/blob/master/alertsetup.JPG" >

>The alert email came through which is refreshing as email alerting is always a pig to setup on many monitoring systems and so much time onsite is wasted with such a simple thing but this was easy!

<img src="https://github.com/Rusk-Hill/Datadogscreenshots/blob/master/alertemail.JPG" >

>Having the ability to set downtime on certain alerts or everything is also great, again quick to setup

<img src="https://github.com/Rusk-Hill/Datadogscreenshots/blob/master/downtime.JPG" >

>I then turned on the process feature on the windows agent

<img src="https://github.com/Rusk-Hill/Datadogscreenshots/blob/master/processconfig.JPG" >

>This was great to see how quickly the data appeared in the monitoring tool and the detail included. I have been used to a soltuion that could only managed 5 minute updates to a collector and then bulk updates from collector to a dashboard. I assume this performance comes at an inpact on resourses required on the host running this? Good though for detailed troubleshooting when having an issue with a perticular machine.

>Before finishing off I saw the APM and Notebook features. APM is such a massive piece of monitoring now and it was completely missing from the product I've been selling. This meant that we couldn't compete in any monitoring opportunities that involved any kind of devops teams. This look to be a very feature rich area too so taking on the likes of Riverbed with their ARX/AIX features should be easy!

>Lastly I really liked the notebook. This looks to be a great replacement for a warroom type situtation where people would have to all arrive in a small meeting room and troubleshoot a major issue. This wastes time with people walking around and usual limits people as they no longer have to comfort or kit they have at their own office/desk! It also looks to be very useful when creating evidenance for troublshootinf and handing an issue off to another team. They will be able to see what you have found with notes/comments added. Again, this is something that I had before but you couldn't create it within the tool itself but you had to screenshot graphs and build a long and usually oversized email to teams of people.


# Final Question:
Datadog has been used in a lot of creative ways in the past. We‚Äôve written some blog posts about using Datadog to monitor the NYC Subway System, Pokemon Go, and even office restroom availability!

Is there anything creative you would use Datadog for?
