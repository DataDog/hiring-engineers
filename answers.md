* The Agent is a piece of software that the user installs onto a host that transmits system metrics and application data to Datadog. The Agent is made up of the collector, which collects system metrics; dogstatsd, which allows the user to send custom application data; and the forwarder, which sends all of the data to Datadog over HTTPS.
