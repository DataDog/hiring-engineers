### Level 1 - Collecting your Data

* Sign up for Datadog (use "Datadog Recruiting Candidate" in the "Company" field), get the Agent reporting metrics from your local machine.
  - [Link to Host Dashboard](https://app.datadoghq.com/dash/host/349301929?live=true&page=0&is_auto=false&from_ts=1507061300792&to_ts=1507064900792&tile_size=m)
  - ![Initial Host Dashboard After Setup]()

* Bonus question: In your own words, what is the Agent?
* Add tags in the Agent config file and show us a screenshot of your host and its tags on the Host Map page in Datadog.
* Install a database on your machine (MongoDB, MySQL, or PostgreSQL) and then install the respective Datadog integration for that database.
* Write a custom Agent check that samples a random value. Call this new metric: `test.support.random`
