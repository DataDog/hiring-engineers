## Bonus Question: What is the difference between a Service and a Resource?
*Service*: Logical group of resources. Example: Transactions Service contains all tables, jobs, queues of that specific goal.

*Resource*: Using the previous example, a resource would be: a SQS Queue, RDS Database, Lambda Steps State Machine, Lambda Function, API Gateway Endpoints, etc.

### Final Question

First of all, I am personally impressed with the tool, I had a lot of fun creating the exercises! There are tons of features that I haven't had time to explore but certinaly I will be doing this soon.

I have a few ideas in my mind but to stick with one: I am coming from Brazil a country known by its beauty of natural resources, beaches, mountains and so on. However, away from the touristic places , the population suffers with an increasing number of crimes happening in all metropolitan areas. Nowadays there are some mobile apps to report crimes (such as robbery, assaults, kidnaps , rapes) and those apps could provide important and centralized metrics to the authorities, allowing them to create an endless set of dashboards to fight against the gangs all over the country.
