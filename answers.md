 # Visualizing Data
What is the Anomaly graph displaying?

 # Monitoring Data
Since this monitor is going to alert pretty often, you don’t want to be alerted when you are out of the office. Set up two scheduled downtimes for this monitor:
> One that silences it from 7pm to 9am daily on M-F,
> And one that silences it all day on Sat-Sun.
> Make sure that your email is notified when you schedule the downtime and take a screenshot of that notification.
