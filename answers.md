# Prerequisites

To begin this exercise, I had to choose an appropriate environment to model Datadogâ€™s functionality that's feasible within the confines of my Chromebook running ChromeOS. I opted to dual-boot my machine to run [GalliumOS](https://galliumos.org/), a lightweight Linux distribution based on Xubuntu, partitioned alongside the ChromeOS. From my new VM, I was easily able to sign up for Datadog and begin running the agent.  

# Collecting Metrics 
Next, I added the below tags into the tags section of my agent configuration file to add some more details on my machine.

```
## @param tags  - list of key:value elements - optional
#
tags:
   - environment:dev
   - chassis:desktop
   - os:galliumos3.1
   - kernel:linux4.16.18
```

Here is my host, named `katelyn.localhost`, and its tags, shown bottom right, on the Host Map page in Datadog.

Then I opted to download a PostgreSQL database on my machine and install the corresponding Datadog integration to begin collecting those metrics and logs.  After creating user `datadog` and granting the role `pg_monitor` to that user,  here is a verification of the correct permissioning on my PostgreSQL database:

To make this integration more meaningful, I wanted to allow for metric collection and log integration.  To do so, I altered my `postgres.d/conf.yaml` configuration file to point to my host/port and to configure logging, shown here: 
```
instances:

    ## @param host - string - required
    ## The hostname to connect to.
    #
  - host: katelyn.localhost

    ## @param port - integer - required
    ## Port to use when connecting to PostgreSQL.
    #
    port: 5432

    ## @param user - string - required
    ## Datadog Username created to connect to PostgreSQL.
    #
    username: datadog

    ## @param pass - string - required
    ## Password associated with the Datadog user.
    #
    password: *******

    ## @param dbname - string - optional - default: postgres
    ## Name of the PostgresSQL database to monitor.
    #
    dbname: datadog
```
```
logs:
 - type: file
   path: "/etc/postgresql/12/main/pg_log.log"
   source: postgresql
   service: pslogservice
```

and altered my machine's `postgresql.conf` file to configure logging, shown here:

```
logging_collector = on                  # Enable capturing of stderr and csvlog
                                        # into log files. Required to be on for
                                        # csvlogs.
                                        # (change requires restart)

# These are only used if logging_collector is on:
log_directory = 'pg_log'                        # directory where log files are written,
                                                # can be absolute or relative to PGDATA
log_filename = 'pg.log'                         # log file name pattern,
                                                # can include strftime() escapes
log_file_mode = 0644                            # creation mode for log files
```

After a quick change to `logs_enabled: true` in my Datadog agent configuration file, my setup was ready to begin log collection. 

The output of a call to `sudo datadog-agent status`, shown below, verifies that the PostgreSQL integration and logging is functioning.
