## Prerequisites - Setup the environment
My environment for this exercise is below :
  Vagrant Ubuntu VM 16.04 (xenial)  
  Docker (Ubuntu 16.04), MySQL on the Vagrant
  
## Collecting Metrics:

* Add tags in the Agent config file and show us a screenshot of your host and its tags on the Host Map page in Datadog.

* Install a database on your machine (MongoDB, MySQL, or PostgreSQL) and then install the respective Datadog integration for that database.

* Create a custom Agent check that submits a metric named my_metric with a random value between 0 and 1000.

* Change your check's collection interval so that it only submits the metric once every 45 seconds.


* **Bonus Question** Can you change the collection interval without modifying the Python check file you created?
