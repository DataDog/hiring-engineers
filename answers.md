# Collecting Metrics:
Add tags in the Agent config file and show us a screenshot of your host and its tags on the Host Map page in Datadog.

## Install a database on your machine (MongoDB, MySQL, or PostgreSQL) and then install the respective Datadog integration for that database.

## Create a custom Agent check that submits a metric named my_metric with a random value between 0 and 1000.
## Change your check's collection interval so that it only submits the metric once every 45 seconds.

## Bonus Question Can you change the collection interval without modifying the Python check file you created?
