## Prerequisites - Setup the environment

### OS setup
I have used Ubuntu on top of VMware for this. Skipping the walkthrough of that part because we have bigger concern here.

### Datadog agent setup

**Step 1.**

Setup a free trial account from Datadog site [here]( https://app.datadoghq.com/signup "Datadog signup") and start using 14 days of evaluation.

**Step 2.**

Now that account has been created, the first landing page after login to the portal will ask to choose the OS. Select Ubuntu there:
