## Collecting Metrics 


## Adding tags

I followed along the [documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/getting_started/tagging/assigning_tags/) I was able to find the datadog.yaml file and make the necessary changes:

- take the comments out the 'tags' section
- change to: 
		tags: project:test,laptop:koshap,role:database
