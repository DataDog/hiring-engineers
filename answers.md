 ## Add tags in the agent config file

Virtual Box does not play nicely with High Sierra, so I chose to install the agent directly on OS X 

I couldn't find a datadog.yaml file within datadog-agent/, but I did fine one within datadog-agent/etc/. I assume this is the correct file seeing as how the tags were shown on the UI
