## Add tags in the Agent config file and show us a screenshot of your host and its tags on the Host Map page in Datadog.
# Collecting Metrics:

## Install a database on your machine (MongoDB, MySQL, or PostgreSQL) and then install the respective Datadog integration for that database.
## Create a custom Agent check that submits a metric named my_metric with a random value between 0 and 1000.

`my_metric.py`
```
import random
from checks import AgentCheck

class my_metric(AgentCheck):
    def check(self, instance):
        myrand = random.randint(1, 1000)
        #force NoData for testing
        #myrand = None
        self.gauge('my_metric', myrand)
```


## Change your check's collection interval so that it only submits the metric once every 45 seconds.
## Bonus Question Can you change the collection interval without modifying the Python check file you created?


# Monitoring:

## Create a new Metric Monitor that watches the average of your custom metric (my_metric) and will alert if itâ€™s above the following values over the past 5 minutes.
