### Level 0 (optional) - Setup an Ubuntu VM

Let's run it in a Google Cloud Platform and test other integrations. Should we?

### Level 1 - Collecting your Data

* Sign up for Datadog (use "Datadog Recruiting Candidate" in the "Company" field), get the Agent reporting metrics from your local machine.
--- It's alive! ![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/makak/hiring-engineers/solutions-engineer/images/really_up_datadog.PNG "Host is alive!") 

* Bonus question: In your own words, what is the Agent?

"""The agent is a python software installed on the server. 
The application perform checks and uploads information to the DataDog servers."""

### Level 2 - Visualizing your Data

* Since your database integration is reporting now, clone your database integration dashboard and add additional database metrics to it as well as your `test.support.random` metric from the custom Agent check.
* Bonus question: What is the difference between a timeboard and a screenboard?

""" The main difference is the data correlation between the graphs on the timeboard.""" 

* Take a snapshot of your `test.support.random` graph and draw a box around a section that shows it going above 0.90. Make sure this snapshot is sent to your email by using the @notification
