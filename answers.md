I'd like to thank everyone at Datadog for considering me for a presales role.  This hiring exercise was awesome - a lot of work but well worth it.  Datadog is kickass, no doubt!

I took a different approach with this exercise and treated it as a POV (or POC) for a potential customer.  Each item is a technical requirement necessary to complete a technical win.  The "customer" is Wayne Enterprises.  Is that fictional enough?

I sent a Dropbox link to my deliverables (documentation, scripts, and code) to:

Alexa Shanahan <alexa.shanahan@datadoghq.com>
Brendan Roche <brendan.roche@datadoghq.com>
Fahim Ghaffar <fahim.ghaffar@datadoghq.com>

I trust this is acceptable.  I understand many folks review these exercises, so please contact the above (or me directly at jonmthompson@gmail.com) if you have questions or if anything needs clarification.

Thanks again!
-Jon
