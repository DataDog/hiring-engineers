# The Challenge

Don't forget to read the **References**.

## Questions

### Level 0 (optional) - Setup an Ubuntu VM

* While it is not required, we recommend that you spin up a fresh linux VM via Vagrant or other tools so that you don't run into any OS or dependency issues. [Here are instructions for setting up a Vagrant Ubuntu 12.04 VM.](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/getting-started/)
>Answer: I am using macOS Sierra Version 10.12.6 for this Challenge.


### Level 1 - Collecting your Data

* Sign up for Datadog (use "Datadog Recruiting Candidate" in the "Company" field), get the Agent reporting metrics from your local machine.

>Answer: Click integration-Agent in DataDog and follow the installation instructions for Mac OS X to install the Agent on my own machine.

* Bonus question: In your own words, what is the Agent?

>Answer: The Datadog agent is a full stack platform/software which brings data from different places via API to Datadog interface.

* Add tags in the Agent config file and show us a screenshot of your host and its tags on the Host Map page in Datadog.

>Answer: Change direction by type cd ~/.datadog-agent in terminal, then type emacs datadog.conf to open and edit the configuration file. (reference: https://docs.datadoghq.com/guides/tagging/)
<img src="https://github.com/jinmei612/datadog_screenshots/blob/master/upload/tagging%20in%20conf%20file.png" />

After a few minutes refresh the Datadog, go to Infrastructure - Host Map, the tags are now shown in there.

* Install a database on your machine (MongoDB, MySQL, or PostgreSQL) and then install the respective Datadog integration for that database.

>Answer: I am using PostgreSQL for this part, for how to download and install the software PostgreSQL please refer to -> [Download PostgreSQL here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

find the PostgreSQL API under Integrations, follow the installation instructions
<img src="https://github.com/jinmei612/datadog_screenshots/blob/master/upload/postgres_yaml.png" />

Type datadog-agent info in Terminal to check states.

* Write a custom Agent check that samples a random value. Call this new metric: `test.support.random`

>Answer:

~/.datadog-agent/checks.d/randomcheck.py

```
import random
from checks import AgentCheck
class RandomCheck(AgentCheck):
    def check(self, instance):
        self.gauge('test.support.random', random.random())
```

~/.datadog-agent/conf.d/randomcheck.yaml

```
init_config:
instances:
    [{}]
```

reference: https://docs.datadoghq.com/guides/agent_checks/

Here is a snippet that prints a random value in python:

```python
import random
print(random.random())
```

### Level 2 - Visualizing your Data

* Since your database integration is reporting now, clone your database integration dashboard and add additional database metrics to it as well as your `test.support.random` metric from the custom Agent check.

>Answer: Go to Dashboard-Dashboard List, select Postgres, then click on Clone Dashboard on the top right corner.
<img src="https://github.com/jinmei612/datadog_screenshots/blob/master/upload/clone%20dashboard.png" />

Click on add new graph and type test.support.randomÂ  in the Get then click Save.

reference: https://docs.datadoghq.com/guides/templating/

* Bonus question: What is the difference between a timeboard and a screenboard?

>Answer: all graphs are always scoped to the same time in timeboard, but screenboard is flexible and more customisable, it can be created by drag and drop widgets.

reference: https://help.datadoghq.com/hc/en-us/articles/204580349-What-is-the-difference-between-a-ScreenBoard-and-a-TimeBoard-

* Take a snapshot of your `test.support.random` graph and draw a box around a section that shows it going above 0.90. Make sure this snapshot is sent to your email by using the @notification

>Answer: click on the camera icon on the top right of the graph and type @person
<img src="https://github.com/jinmei612/datadog_screenshots/blob/master/upload/notification.png" />


### Level 3 - Alerting on your Data

Since you've already caught your test metric going above 0.90 once, you don't want to have to continually watch this dashboard to be alerted when it goes above 0.90 again.  So let's make life easier by creating a monitor.
* Set up a monitor on this metric that alerts you when it goes above 0.90 at least once during the last 5 minutes

>Answer: click on the setting icon - create Monitor on the top right of the graph
<img src="hhttps://github.com/jinmei612/datadog_screenshots/blob/master/upload/create%20monitor.png" />

<img src="https://github.com/jinmei612/datadog_screenshots/blob/master/upload/alert.png" />

reference: https://docs.datadoghq.com/guides/monitors/

* Bonus points:  Make it a multi-alert by host so that you won't have to recreate it if your infrastructure scales up.

>Answer: select Multi Alert under 2-Define the metric, has been done in the previous step.

* Give it a descriptive monitor name and message (it might be worth it to include the link to your previously created dashboard in the message).  Make sure that the monitor will notify you via email.
<img src="https://github.com/jinmei612/datadog_screenshots/blob/master/upload/alert2.png" />


* This monitor should alert you within 15 minutes. So when it does, take a screenshot of the email that it sends you.
<img src="https://github.com/jinmei612/datadog_screenshots/blob/master/upload/email%20notif.png" />


* Bonus: Since this monitor is going to alert pretty often, you don't want to be alerted when you are out of the office. Set up a scheduled downtime for this monitor that silences it from 7pm to 9am daily. Make sure that your email is notified when you schedule the downtime and take a screenshot of that notification.

>Answer: Monitors - Manage Downtime - Schedule Downtime
