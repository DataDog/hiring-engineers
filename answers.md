Hello - Below are my responses to the hiring excercise. If there's any clarification I can provide please let me know. Thank you. 


###### Add tags in the Agent config file and show us a screenshot of your host and its tags on the Host Map page in Datadog.

- Added the role, location, and resource_name tags to datadog.yaml file

Install a database on your machine (MongoDB, MySQL, or PostgreSQL) and then install the respective Datadog integration for that database.
Create a custom Agent check that submits a metric named my_metric with a random value between 0 and 1000.
Change your check's collection interval so that it only submits the metric once every 45 seconds.
Bonus Question Can you change the collection interval without modifying the Python check file you created?
