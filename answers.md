## Collecting Metrics:

- [x] Add tags in the Agent config file and show us a screenshot of your host and its tags on the Host Map page in Datadog.

- [x] Install a database on your machine (MongoDB, MySQL, or PostgreSQL) and then install the respective Datadog integration for that database.

**PostgreSQL integration info check in terminal**

- [x] Create a custom Agent check that submits a metric named my_metric with a random value between 0 and 1000.

- [x] Change your check's collection interval so that it only submits the metric once every 45 seconds.

- [x] **Bonus Question** Can you change the collection interval without modifying the Python check file you created?
        No, I was not able to find an alternative to changing the collection interval without modifying the Python check file.

## Visualizing Data:

Utilize the Datadog API to create a Timeboard that contains:

- [x] Your custom metric scoped over your host.
- [x] Any metric from the Integration on your Database with the anomaly function applied.
- [x] Your custom metric with the rollup function applied to sum up all the points for the past hour into one bucket
<img width="1009" alt="timeboard" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17325777/44104994-58d230c0-9fbe-11e8-8395-d718f3aecede.png">

- [x] Please be sure, when submitting your hiring challenge, to include the script that you've used to create this Timeboard.

**Below you will see the script utizlized for creating the timeboard.  I npm installed the dogapi package and created the script according to the documention for creating a timeboard.  The timeboard was generated by running node *[file name]* in the terminal**

```javascript
var dogapi = require("dogapi");
var options = {
  api_key: DD_API_KEY,
  app_key: DD_APP_KEY
};
dogapi.initialize(options);
var title = "Visualizing Data";
var description = "A timeboard for hiring exercise. Custom metric shown with system load";
var graphs = [
  {
    definition: {
      events: [],
      requests: [
        {q: "avg:system.load.1{*}"}, 
        {q: "avg:my_metric{*}"}
      ],
      viz: "timeseries"
    },
    title: "custom metric"
  },
  {
    definition: {
      events: [],
      requests: [
        {q: "sum:my_metric{host:Rachels-MBP-2.home} by {host}"}
      ],
      viz: "timeseries"
    },
    title: "my_metric over host"
  }, 
  {
    definition: {
      events: [],
      requests: [
        {q: "my_metric{host:Rachels-MBP-2.home} by {host}.rollup(sum, 3600)"}
      ],
      viz: "timeseries"
    },
    title: "my_metric rolled-up every hour"
  },
  {
    definition: {
      events: [],
      requests: [
        {q: "anomalies(avg:postgresql.rows_returned{db:movie_ratings}, 'basic', 2)"}
      ],
      viz: "timeseries"
    },
    title: "postgreSQL anomaly"
  }
];
var templateVariables = [
  {
    name: "host1",
    prefix: "host",
    "default": "host:Rachels-MBP-2.home"
  }
];
dogapi.timeboard.create(
  title, description, graphs, options, templateVariables,
  function(err, res){
    console.dir(res);
  }
);



```

Once this is created, access the Dashboard from your Dashboard List in the UI:

- [] Set the Timeboard's timeframe to the past 5 minutes
- [x] Take a snapshot of this graph and use the @ notation to send it to yourself.
- [x] **Bonus Question**: What is the Anomaly graph displaying?
      The anomaly graph is displaying the historical "normal" output of the rows returned from the postgreSQL database movies_ratings.  The gray area outside of the blue line-graph is the "boarder" of what is expected to be normal behavior or returned data.  Anything that falls outside of the normal/expecected behavor will be returned in red.  

## Monitoring Data
Since you’ve already caught your test metric going above 800 once, you don’t want to have to continually watch this dashboard to be alerted when it goes above 800 again. So let’s make life easier by creating a monitor.

- [x] Create a new Metric Monitor that watches the average of your custom metric (my_metric) and will alert if it’s above the following values over the past 5 minutes:

- [x] Warning threshold of 500
- [x] Alerting threshold of 800
- [x] And also ensure that it will notify you if there is No Data for this query over the past 10m.

Please configure the monitor’s message so that it will:

- [x] Send you an email whenever the monitor triggers.

- [x] Create different messages based on whether the monitor is in an Alert, Warning, or No Data state.

- [x] Include the metric value that caused the monitor to trigger and host ip when the Monitor triggers an Alert state.

- [x] When this monitor sends you an email notification, take a screenshot of the email that it sends you.

**Monitor email notification re: No Data**
<img width="778" alt="monitor-nodata-alert-email" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17325777/44128310-52a06cec-a010-11e8-9869-ed67bca23f50.png">

**Monitor email Threshold alert with alert triggering value and host name**
<img width="796" alt="monitor-alert-email" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17325777/44128337-74d2e9e8-a010-11e8-8166-7d864d64d7d2.png">

- [x] **Bonus Question:** Since this monitor is going to alert pretty often, you don’t want to be alerted when you are out of the office. Set up two scheduled downtimes for this monitor:

- [x] One that silences it from 7pm to 9am daily on M-F,
- [x] one that silences it all day on Sat-Sun.
- [x] Make sure that your email is notified when you schedule the downtime and take a screenshot of that notification.

## Collecting APM Data:

Given the following Flask app (or any Python/Ruby/Go app of your choice) instrument this using Datadog’s APM solution:

```python 
from flask import Flask
import logging
import sys

# Have flask use stdout as the logger
main_logger = logging.getLogger()
main_logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
c = logging.StreamHandler(sys.stdout)
formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
c.setFormatter(formatter)
main_logger.addHandler(c)

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def api_entry():
    return 'Entrypoint to the Application'

@app.route('/api/apm')
def apm_endpoint():
    return 'Getting APM Started'

@app.route('/api/trace')
def trace_endpoint():
    return 'Posting Traces'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port='5050')

```
Note: Using both ddtrace-run and manually inserting the Middleware has been known to cause issues. Please only use one or the other.

- [x] **Bonus Question:** What is the difference between a Service and a Resource?


- [] Provide a link and a screenshot of a Dashboard with both APM and Infrastructure Metrics.

- [] Please include your fully instrumented app in your submission, as well.

I was unable to successfully install the APM trace-agent for this portion of the exercise. The APM Agent Trace must be downloaded manually with OSX.  I was not able to do that.  When trying to download via the [trace-agent-darwin-amd64-6.4.1](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-trace-agent/releases/download/6.4.1/trace-agent-darwin-amd64-6.4.1), but ran into the following issue: 

<img width="579" alt="screen shot 2018-08-15 at 5 08 24 pm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17325777/44183593-97354c00-a0d9-11e8-9c0d-82e5ae14c526.png">

I searched for an alternative way to download the agent trace.  
1.  The most relevant solution found was via closed issue [Error when run in mac osx #397](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-trace-agent/issues/397).  
2.  In reviewing this issue, I attempted to download the trace agent via an older version that included mac osx binaries [trace-agent-osx]( https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-trace-agent/releases?after=5.21.1), but ran into the same issue as above.
3. I reached out for assistance via the Datadog Public Slack channel

4.  I downloaded GO and attempted, set up the go variables and attempted to download the trace agent via the development setup found here: [APM Trace Agent Github](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-trace-agent)

## Final Question:
Datadog has been used in a lot of creative ways in the past. We’ve written some blog posts about using Datadog to monitor the NYC Subway System, Pokemon Go, and even office restroom availability!

Is there anything creative you would use Datadog for?

I think it would be really interesting to track my cat's meowing in order to attempt to identify exactly what he is saying.  I would need to track the pitch, length, and frequency of the meows.  In addition I believe that I would also need to track the human responses to the meows that elicited the desired quieting of the cat.
