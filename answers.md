# Logan Morales - Technical Exercise

## Prerequisites - Setup the environment

To set up my environment, I chose to utulize Virtualbox to spin up an Ubuntu Virtual Machine. The benefit of using a virtual machine over a native system, in my opinion, is the convenience of what I like to call... 'Nuking it'.

If something goes wrong, or I make a few config changes that don't play nice with other services, I have the luxury of nuking it and starting fresh within just a few moments. While working with new technologies (and even with familiar ones) it is very comforting to have this fail safe in place - it makes me feel safe to know nothing I do is affecting my core machine and I am working in a complete sandbox. 

After getting my VM up and running, I created a trial account with Datadog and started sniffing around. I added my Ubuntu integration, used the install script to get my system connected and within a few moments, began to see metrics from my VM coming in.

## Collecting Metrics

### Tags... Oh tags.

Following alongside the [documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/getting_started/tagging/assigning_tags/) I was able to locate the `datadog.yaml` config file inside of `/etc/datadog-agent` and make a few changes:

- `sudo nano datadog.yaml`
- Uncomment out the 'tags' section
- Change to:
```
tags:
	- name:logan
	- applying_for:solutions_engineer
```

My configuration file looks like this:

I restarted the datadog- agent using 
`sudo service datadog-agent restart` 
so that the agent would read the updated config file and my tags populated inside of Datadog's interface within a few minutes:

### Lets get that database going!

I was first introduced into databases during my time at General Assembly where we learned PostgreSQL. Recently, I have been working with MySQL quite a lot and I'm going to use this for my database integration. 

I took the following steps to get this going:
	
1. `sudo apt-get update` to update the package index
2. `sudo apt-get install mysql-server` to install MySQL
3. Follow the [Datadog documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/getting_started/tagging/assigning_tags/) for installing the MySQL integration:
	- I created a user for the datadog agent with rights to the MySQL Server using the commands:

	```
	sudo mysql -e "CREATE USER 'datadog'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '$password'
	sudo mysql -e "GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'datadog'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;"
	```

	- I also opted to receive full metrics catalog by using the following command provided in the docs:

	```
	sudo mysql -e "GRANT PROCESS ON *.* TO 'datadog'@'localhost';"
	sudo mysql -e "GRANT SELECT ON performance_schema.* TO 'datadog'@'localhost';"
	```

	- Moving on! Next I edited the MySQL config file for datadog inside of `/etc/datadog-agent/conf.d/mysql.d/` to connect MySQL to my agent. I created a working copy of the example file 
	(`conf.yaml.example`) using `cp conf.yaml.example ./conf.yaml` and un-commented out the lines corresponding to the documentation provided by Datadog:

	```
	init_config:

	instances:
	  	server: localhost
    	user: datadog
    	pass: $password 
    	tags:
        	optional_tag1
        	optional_tag2
    	options:
        	replication: 0
        	galera_cluster: 1
	```

   Here is a screenshot of my configuration file (`/etc/datadog-agent/conf.d/mysql.d/conf.yaml`):

   - I then restarted my agent - `sudo service datadog-agent restart` and ran a check command `sudo datadog-agent check mysql | more` . I appended `| more` so that I could scroll through the results. 

   Here is a screenshot of the check command results:

   And here is Datadog web interface reporting the metrics from my MySQL integration:

### Custom Agent reporting metrics with random integer between 1 and 1000.

To understand the process of doing this, I spent a lot of time reading over the [documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/developers/agent_checks/) provided by Datadog. Following along with the documentation, here are the steps that I took:

1. `cd /etc/datadog-agent/conf.d/` getting into the directory for the .yaml file.
2. `sudo touch my_metric.yaml` creating a new config file, sudo rights required.
3. `sudo nano my_metric.yaml` to edit the file and filled with:

	```
	# barebones configuration boilerplate
	
	init_config: 	

	instances:
    	[{}]
	```

   Here is a screenshot of my configuration file:

4. `cd /etc/datadog-agent/checks.d/` getting into the directory for the python script.
5. `sudo touch my_metric.py` must be the same name as the .yaml created in step 2, sudo rights required.
6. `sudo nano my_metric.py` to edit the file and filled with:
	
	```
	from checks import AgentCheck	# Required, inherits from AgentCheck
	import random					# import random number package

	class CustomCheck(AgentCheck):  # define class CustomCheck
		def check(self, instance):
			self.gauge('my_metric', random.randint(0,1000))
	```

   Here is a screenshot of my python file:
