# Datadog Solutions Engineer Exercise
A technical exercise for the Solutions Engineering interview process at Datadog.

Datadog is a cloud-scale monitoring service that creates a single pane of glass
for the metrics and events generated by modern software solutions. Those
solutions can span numerous cloud and service providers with SOA and
micro-service architectures where messaging, queuing, caching, routing, and
service discovery are critical working components. These resources can be
configured and deployed in a host of ways, from containers, to virtual machines,
to bare metal.

Datadog boasts a huge library of integrations that allows customers to get
metrics into their system quickly and easily from almost any source, be it an
application, a database, tooling, a cloud provider, or third party services. And
with an API first approach developers can build custom integrations and push
custom metrics with ease. Even Graphs and Dashboards can be codified!

Datadog doesn't stop there. Real-time interactive dashboards enable customers to
quickly correlate data from all these sources and check the overall health of
their environments. Datadog can be configured to alert customers before
something goes wrong and operations teams can discuss in real-time about what
they are seeing within the dashboard itself. This keeps the context and history
relevant to the metrics at that moment in time.
