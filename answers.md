This is Michael Hawley's submission for a Sales Engineer/Solutions engineer role. I decided for the sake of originality to make a sudo (hah get it?) tutorial, to help outline the steps I took for this challenge and present it in a way that a potential end user could follow easily.

## Environment

While you can use any environment really, the recommended option is to use a virtual machine, linux-based, a simple way to ssh into. To learn a new tool for my own personal experience, I used Vagrant with an Ubuntu OS. It's highly recommended that you're on 16.0 or later to avoid any dependency issues with package management.
