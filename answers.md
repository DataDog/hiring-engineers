## Prerequisites - Setup the environment

### OS setup
I have used Ubuntu on top of VMware for this. Skipping the walkthrough of that part because we have bigger concern here.

### Datadog agent setup

** Step 1. **

Setup a free trial account from Datadog site [here]( https://app.datadoghq.com/signup "Datadog signup") and start using 14 days of evaluation. Login to the Datadog web portal to start.
