# Level 1

### Bonus Question: In your own words, what is an Agent?
*An agent is a piece of software that performs processing tasks in the background.

### Add tags in the Agent config file and show us a screenshot of your host and its tags on the Host Map page in Datadog.
*I had to dig around on the documentation to figure out which file I was specifically going to need to work with.  Once found, I search for the section on tags and made the neccecary changes to add custom tags.  I then restarted the Datadog agent and made sure the tags were able to be search for on the Host Map.
