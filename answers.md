Level 1:

I set up my Datadog account with name Roger Berlind and e-mail rberlind@optonline.net. I actually set up my Datadog account with company "Job Seeker" before starting this interview exercise, but I was then able to change the name of the organization to "Datadog Recruiting Candidate" on the organization settings screen to better match the instructions and avoid any confusion.

Before starting the exercise, I deployed the Datadog agent on my Windows 7 laptop, Thorsby, and on an AWS EC2 instance with public DNS ec2-54-147-87-50.compute-1.amazonaws.com running Tomcat and MySQL on Ubuntu.  I also set up the AWS, EC2, Tomcat, and MySQL integrations on the Linux instance.

The Datadog agent is software that collects performance metrics and events from monitored hosts and technologies and sends them to Datadog's SaaS environment.  Users can then log into their Datadog account with a web browser and easily monitor and diagnose the performance of their cloud, hybrid, and on-premise infrastructure and the applications that run on it.  The agent is very lightweight and secure.
