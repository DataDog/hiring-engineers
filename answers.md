# Answer for Recuiting Challenge
I took the docker-containerized approach to complete the Challenge.  
You can reproduce the environment by docker-compose with a deploy script.  
**```DD_API_KEY="<DatadogAPIKEY>" YOUR_LOCAL_IP="<LOCAL_HOST_IP>" sh deploy_local.sh```  **  
The script launches four containers (web, app, db, and datadog-agent) in your computer with `YOUR_LOCAL IP`.  
Following is the flow for containers to launch.
```
1. Postgres db starts with datadog user to be monitored.
2. Datadog agent starts with configured yaml files inside.
3. Django app starts with APM config after database migration.
    #Docker host ip is 172.19.0.1. Change if needed.
4. Nginx starts http web service as frontend.
```
 Access http://`YOUR_LOCAL_IP`, which works with all the configs mentioned in the answer.

### A custom Agent check with a random value between 0 and 1000.

* [x] Agent check python: [test_check.py](datadog/checks.d/test_check.py)  
```python
__version__ = "1.0.0"

from checks import AgentCheck
import random
class HelloCheck(AgentCheck):
    def check(self, instance):
        some_num = random.randint(0,1001) #Return random integers from low (inclusive) to high (exclusive)
        self.gauge('my_metric', some_num, tags=['test_check'])
```
