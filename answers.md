## Introduction

Hello there! My name is Alex Gabrielian and I am applying for the Technical Account Manager role at Datadog.
As a part of my application, I was asked to complete the Solutions Engineer technical exercise which you will find below with both my code and the screenshots supporting my work.

## Setting up the environment

I decided to utilize the containerized approach with Docker for Linux. 
After creating a Datadog account, I obtained my unique Datadog API key from the online User Interface (UI). Then, I ran the installation command to install a Datadog container on my local host which pulled a Docker image from Docker hub and ran it to create the container.
