Welcome to my answer page for the Challenge, I really liked doing it and I'm looking forward to hearing from you if you have feedback.
All the best,
Charly

My document is divided in two parts, the first one is a pragmatic text that lists my answers to the challenge step by step.
The second is the V0 of a tutorial, based on my attempt to do the challenge using the collaborative node.js APIs.

##Challenge 
#####This part is dedicated to the answers of the questions for the coding challenge of [Datadog](datadoghq.com). I chose to do the challenge using python, given the fact that the library for python was really well documented. My knowledge in python is only about signal processing yet. You'll find here, my answers for the different levels, step by step. With my reflexions and the troubleshoot I faced, with the solution I found.

##Tutorial
#####In this second part, I'd like to propound a tutorial. At first, I tried to do the challenge with the Node.js APIs but the hard time I had trying to figure out the ways to reach the results, made me thinking that it could be useful to have a tutorial. The basis is still the same, the challenge, yet the reasons why I'm doing it are the following:

 - The documentation for the Node.js API is not sufficient for someone that isn't familiar with it
 - Showing my abilities to convey a clear message, which is one of the most important asset needed in this job.
