Bonus Question: Since this monitor is going to alert pretty often, you donâ€™t want to be alerted when you are out of the office. Set up two scheduled downtimes for this monitor:

One that silences it from 7pm to 9am daily on M-F,
And one that silences it all day on Sat-Sun.
Make sure that your email is notified when you schedule the downtime and take a screenshot of that notification.
