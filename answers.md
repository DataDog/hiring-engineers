# Prerequisites - Setup the environment

To complete this exercise I had to download both [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)



After signing up for an account, I navigated to the Integrations Tab --> Agent Tab --> Ubuntu Tab.
