What I build
------------
 - I used a containerized approach as it is easy to setup and consumes less laptop resources
 - I used the following dockerfile for spining up the necessary machines for this test:
    + Postgres (Database Machine)
    + Adminer (Managing Database)
    + Datadog Agent (Monitoring Agent)
 
 If you don't have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or [Pygame](http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml) installed, you can simply double click the .exe file to play the game.
   **Note:** *The .exe file needs to stay in the same directory as the sounds, images, and font folders.*
   
 - If you have the correct version of Python and Pygame installed, you can run the program in the command prompt / terminal.
 ``` bash
cd SpaceInvaders
python spaceinvaders.py
 ```
 **Note:** If you're using Python 3, replace the command "python" with "python3"
