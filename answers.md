# Datadog Solutions Engineer Exercises - Matthew Tessler

## Prequisites - Setup the Environment

I am completing this exercise on a Mac OS X operating system. To avoid dependency issues, as the instructions recommended, I decided to spin up a fresh linux VM via Vagrant. I followed their [instructions](https://www.vagrantup.com/intro/getting-started/). I ran the command `vagrant init hashicorp/precise64` to create the virtual machine.

Then I started up the virtual machine with the command `vagrant up` and ran the command `vagrant ssh` to interface with the virtual machine.

I then signed for a Datadog account.
