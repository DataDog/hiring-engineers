1.) Bonus question: In your own words, what is the Agent?
	The agent is a piece of software that runs on your computer and gathers events and system metrics such as memory and CPU. It then queues these up to be sent to Datadog where you can monitor and track this information.

2.) Bonus question: What is the difference between a timeboard and a screenboard?
	Timeboards and screenboards are customizable dashboards available in datadog.
	They allow you to drag and drop widegets to display graphs and charts all
	in one place. Timeboards are less flexible than screenboards and allow you to
	display items in a grid-like fashion. Each widget must be set to the same timeframe. 
	Timeboards are better for troubleshooting and correlation. Screenboards are more flexible and provide a high level look into a system. Each widget can be set to a different timeframe. Screenboards can be shared as a whole and as read-only entities while timeboards can be shared individually.
