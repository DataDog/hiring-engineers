The excercises were very challanging but a really good learning experience. I did have issues with the last one as I could not get PIP or Flask woring correctly in my Vagrant environment. I believe the issue may have something to do with the Ubuntu version that vagrant uses (12.04) but not 100% sure. 
I'm also new to GitHub and I'm not sure how you want me to respond to the questions, I uploaded all the screen shots and files to my fork so I assume you can see them there. The URL for my dashboard that has the exmaples in it can be found here: https://app.datadoghq.com/dash/840545/my-cool-metrics2?live=true&page=0&is_auto=false&from_ts=1529700828621&to_ts=1529704428621&tile_size=m

While I thought the excercises are a good idea and will show how resourceful a candidate is, I think you could add some stuff that would make it better for SE's. I would ask some questions that also have a sales context. Maybe have them create different dashboards for different audiences (app owner, tech lead, IT executive). I see the power of Datadog in it's flexibility and I can see how it would be appealing to developers but how would you pitch it to IT operators or managers, how would it replace some of the existing products out there? Why is it better?
