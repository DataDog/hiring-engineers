# Collecting Metrics:

## Requirements
- Vagrant

## Installing datadog agent

``` bash
DD_API_KEY=my_keyXXXXXX bash -c "$(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/master/cmd/agent/install_script.sh)"
```
# Collecting Metrics

* We need to a tag as follows

``` bash
# vi /etc/datadog-agent/datadog.yaml
```
``` bash
# add tags
tags:
  - env:ubuntu:local
```
``` bash
# service datadog-agent restart
```

We use MySQL as an example of integration and follow installation instructions provided
* Install a database on your machine (MongoDB, MySQL, or PostgreSQL) and then install the respective Datadog integration for that database.
``` bash

# Configure the Agent to connect to MySQL
vi /etc/datadog-agent/conf.d/mysql.yaml

init_config:

instances:
  - server: localhost
    user: datadog
    pass: mypass
    tags:
        - optional_tag1
        - optional_tag2
    options:
      replication: 0
      galera_cluster: 1
      
# restart the agent
service datadog-agent restart

# check agent status (mysql)
datadog-agent status
...

 mysql (1.5.0)
    -------------
      Instance ID: mysql:4fblah49a9ad6c6f1 [OK]   
...

```

Create the custom check

```bash
#add custom metrics
vi /etc/datadog-agent/conf.d/my_metric.yaml

instances: [{}]
```
```bash
#create check

vi /etc/datadog-agent/checks.d/my_metric.py

from random import randint
# the following try/except block will make the custom check compatible with any Agent version
try:
    # first, try to import the base class from old versions of the Agent...
    from checks import AgentCheck
except ImportError:
    # ...if the above failed, the check is running in Agent version 6 or later
    from datadog_checks.checks import AgentCheck

# content of the special variable __version__ will be shown in the Agent status page
__version__ = "1.0.0"


class RandomCheck(AgentCheck):
    def check(self, instance):
        self.gauge('my_metric', randint(0,1000))

# restart agent
service datadog-agent restart

# check the check is ok
datadog-agent check my_metric

```

Change your check's collection interval so that it only submits the metric once every 45 seconds

```bash
#add min_collection_interval
vi /etc/datadog-agent/conf.d/my_metric.yaml

init_config:

instances:
  - min_collection_interval: 45
  
# restart agent
service datadog-agent restart

```

- Bonus Question Can you change the collection interval without modifying the Python check file you created?

  By changing the interval at the instance level in the yaml file.

# Visualizing Data

We need to get the API authorization sorted by requesting API Keys and Application key.
We create a new application key in the in the accountâ€™s API [view](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#api).

The script used to create the timeboard can be found [here](https://github.com/cmcornejocrespo/hiring-engineers/blob/solutions-engineer/visualizing-task/create-timeboard.sh).

- Bonus Question: What is the Anomaly graph displaying? 
It allows you to identify when a metric threshold based on basic algorithm is behaving differently than it was over the past.
