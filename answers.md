The Datadog Agent is a software package that collects your servers performance data.
On every machine on which the agent is run, data will be collected regarding the processes,
CPU, memory, network, disk utilization, etc.. and transfer this data back to Datadog's database. The
collected information is then neatly displayed by Datadog's visualization dashboards, which 
allows you to see how your enviornment is behaving.




Time boards are used to visualize data in a time consitent manner. You use a time board
to capture metrics like disk io, network utilizaiton, requests to a data base, and the
time board will display the information as a time series so you can easily correlate
behavior in one graph to another.

A Screen board is another data visualization tool that lets you display all of your
metrics in once place. For example, a screen board might contain time series graphs
like a time board, but it can also display other current metrics like current tickets
not resolved, max user counts, notes, logos and other helpful statistics that dont
necessarily need to be time related.
