#### Datadog Hiring Exercise - Sales Engineer NYC
###### November, 2021

First things first... I really appreciate the opportunity to complete this exercise and progress through the interview process. Admittedly, this project was daunting from the second I looked at the assignment. Between juggling closing out a strong October in my current position as an Account Executive and training for the NYC Marathon coming up this weekend, I knew I had my work cut out for me!
