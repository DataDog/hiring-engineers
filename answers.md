In order to demonstrate some of the main features of DataDog, here is a quick run-through of how to get started on a few of them.

To get started you'll need a couple of things.

First, you'll need a machine to work on. You can [install a VM with vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/intro/getting-started/) pretty quickly if you don't want to get your personal machine too messy.

Next, sign up for a trial at the [Datadog website.](https://app.datadoghq.com/signup)

Finally you'll have to install a datdog agent onto the machine you're working with. I'm running Ubuntu on my VM, but you can find your operating system [here](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#agent) and install the agent that way. This agent will report the metrics you configure to the Datadog website and you'll be able to view the data there after logging in. 

If you have any trouble with that last step you can refer to [the excellent datadog docs and guides.](https://docs.datadoghq.com/getting_started/agent/?tab=datadogussite)


Now that that's out of the way, let's dive in!
