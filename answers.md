I would like to start off by saying, this is the most interesting and intuitive techinal hiring exercise I have taken. Thanks much for give the opportunity.

Note: All the screenshots are in the Screenshots Folder. And the scripts are in the folder Code.

### Setup the environment

  I had setup two Ubuntu 16.04 enviroments just to see variations in the setup.
    - On Windows 10 using Virtual box.
    - On Mac OS with Vagrant(Virtual Box as provider for base env)
  
  
  The datadog config file used for this exercise.

  ```yaml
  dd_url: https://app.datadoghq.com

  api_key: b95c8e083ceec42accc4af841d80187d

  skip_ssl_validation: false

  hostname: AishVM-Vagrant

  tags:
    - env:Mac_Vagrant(VB)
    - os:Ubuntu_Xenial
    -


  procfs_path: /proc


  process_config:
    enabled: "true"

  apm_config:
    enabled: true
  ```

  
  
  
### Collecting Metrics

  - Installed Datadog agent on both the VM's
  - Created custom tags for both the agents  
  - Observed both the agents reporting on the Host Map page on Datadog website.
    
  - __`Both the hosts on the Host Map page`__

  - __`Host with custom tags`__
  
    <img src="https://github.com/aish241093/hiring-engineers/blob/AishwaryaG_Solutions_Engineer/Screenshots/HostMap_with_tags.png">
  
  
  - Installed Postgres database and installed the respective integration from the Integrations page in Datadog.
  
  - __`Postgres agent reporting to the datadog`__
  
    <img src="https://github.com/aish241093/hiring-engineers/blob/AishwaryaG_Solutions_Engineer/Screenshots/Database%20inegration%20-postgres.png"> 
  
  - Created a custom agent check python file in the /datadog-agent/checks.d/ and its respective config file with the custom interval in the /datadog-agent/conf.d/
  - Verified that the agent config file is good by running "datadog-agent configcheck"
    
  - __`Screenshot for the config check`__ 
    
    <img src="https://github.com/aish241093/hiring-engineers/blob/AishwaryaG_Solutions_Engineer/Screenshots/Custom_metric%20with%20interval.png">
    
  - __`The python code for the check file`__ 
    ```python
    #!/usr/bin/env python
    __version__="1.0.0.1"

    from checks import AgentCheck
    from random import randint
    class MyMetricCheck(AgentCheck):
    def check(self, instance):
        self.gauge('my_metric', randint(0, 1000))
    ```
    
  - __`The configuration yaml file for the same`__
    ```yaml
    init_config:

    instances:
      - min_collection_interval: 45
    ```
    
  - Verfied that the custom metric created reports the value to the datadog collection, on the datadog Host Map page.
    
  - __`Screenshot for the above from Datadog page`__
    
    <img src="https://github.com/aish241093/hiring-engineers/blob/AishwaryaG_Solutions_Engineer/Screenshots/Custom_metric.png">
    
    
  - *__Bonus Question:__ Can you change the collection interval without modifying the Python check file you created?*
      
      __`Yes, it possible to change the collection interval in the configuration file in the /datadog-agent/conf.d/`__
       
       
       
       
### Visualizing Data


  - Time board with name Aishwarya_TimeBoard with required content was created.
  
  - Screenshot for the Timeboard from the Datadog page
    
    <img src="https://github.com/aish241093/hiring-engineers/blob/AishwaryaG_Solutions_Engineer/Screenshots/Timeboard.png">
  
  - __`The python script for all three timeboards`__ 
    ```python
    #!/usr/bin/env python3.6

    from datadog import initialize, api

    options = {
        'api_key': 'b95c8e083ceec42accc4af841d80187d',
        'app_key': '0ee42a306f7a5aab45073e4a30587d5c0eb3408e'
    }

    initialize(**options)

      ],
      "autoscale": true,

    }]

    template_variables = []

    read_only = True

    api.Timeboard.create(title=title,
                         description=description,
                         graphs=graphs,

                         read_only=read_only)
    ```
        
  - Changed the timeboard's timeframe to the past 5 minutes and sent it to myself.

    <img src="https://github.com/aish241093/hiring-engineers/blob/AishwaryaG_Solutions_Engineer/Screenshots/Snapshot_to_self.png">

  
  - *__Bonus Question:__ What is the Anomaly graph displaying?*
    
      __`The anamoly graph displays any deviation of metrics from the normal average. In my case, I used the Postgres checkpoint function as input, it perform a check between the data file and write ahead log every five minutes. So we got a graph that spikes every five minutes. And it is caught as a anomaly by the graph.`__

      

### Monitoring Data

  - *The monitor has been created for the custom metric with the required configurations:
      Warning threshold of 500
      Alerting threshold of 800
      And also ensure that it will notify you if there is No Data for this query over the past 10m.*
      
  - __`Screenshot of the monitor config`__
   
   <img src="https://github.com/aish241093/hiring-engineers/blob/AishwaryaG_Solutions_Engineer/Screenshots/Metric_config.png">  
      
  - __`Screenshot for monitoring warning event notification sent to Email`__ 
      
    <img src="https://github.com/aish241093/hiring-engineers/blob/AishwaryaG_Solutions_Engineer/Screenshots/Metric_monitor_email_warn.png">  
      
      
  - __`Screenshot with the warning notification from the monitor in the Datadog events`__
      
    <img src="https://github.com/aish241093/hiring-engineers/blob/AishwaryaG_Solutions_Engineer/Screenshots/Metric_monitor_event_warn.png">  
      
  
  - *__Bonus Question:__ Since this monitor is going to alert pretty often, you donâ€™t want to be alerted when you are out of the office. Set up two scheduled downtimes for this monitor:*

       - *One that silences it from 7pm to 9am daily on M-F,
       - And one that silences it all day on Sat-Sun.
       - Make sure that your email is notified when you schedule the downtime and take a screenshot of that notification.*

      
  The above was achieved by creating the downtime schedule. Screenshots attached for the same.

### Collecting APM Data


  An app was created based on the framework given in the hiring exercise.
  
  - __`Screenshot for curl commands`__ 
  
  <img src="https://github.com/aish241093/hiring-engineers/blob/AishwaryaG_Solutions_Engineer/Screenshots/app_curl.png">
  
  
  - __`Screenshot of APP metrics in the APM page in Datadog`__ 

  <img src="https://github.com/aish241093/hiring-engineers/blob/AishwaryaG_Solutions_Engineer/Screenshots/app_apm_page.png">


  The code for the app in python
  
  ```python
  from flask import Flask
  import logging
  import sys
  from random import randint
  import datetime


  main_logger = logging.getLogger()
  main_logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
  c = logging.StreamHandler(sys.stdout)
  formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
  c.setFormatter(formatter)
  main_logger.addHandler(c)

  app = Flask(__name__)

  @app.route('/')
  def api_entry():
      return 'Welcome to the Application\nFor date got to navigate to /date\nTo find your lucky number navigate to /lucky :P \n'

  @app.route('/date')
  def date():
      return "The time now is {}\n".format(datetime.datetime.now())

  @app.route('/lucky')
  def lucky():
      return "Your lucky number is {} :-)\n".format(randint(1,9))

  if __name__ == '__main__':
      app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port='8500')
  ```

  - *__Bonus Question:__ What is the difference between a Service and a Resource?*
      
      __`Service is a process that is run to accomplish a particular objective. A service is dependant on resources.
        Resource are elements required for a service to run. Like memory, cpu and or even a config file.`__



### Final Question


Datadog has been used in a lot of creative ways in the past. Weâ€™ve written some blog posts about using Datadog to monitor the NYC Subway System, Pokemon Go, and even office restroom availability!

Is there anything creative you would use Datadog for?

   __`- Use it to visualize JIRA's, to see bug reports and areas of most bugs. Would be really nice to have.`__
   __`- I would like to use the street parking data to create an information map on what is available.'__
