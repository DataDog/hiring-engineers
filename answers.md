Collecting Metrics
  - Add tags in the Agent config file and show us a screenshot of your host and its tags on the Host Map page in Datadog.
      - Completed: Refer to 1-tags1.PNG, 1-tags2.PNG
  - Install a database on your machine (MongoDB, MySQL, or PostgreSQL) and then install the respective Datadog integration for that database.
  - Create a custom Agent check that submits a metric named my_metric with a random value between 0 and 1000.
  - Change your check's collection interval so that it only submits the metric once every 45 seconds.
  - Bonus Question Can you change the collection interval without modifying the Python check file you created?
