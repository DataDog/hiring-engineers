## Level 2 - Visualizing Your Data
* Bonus Question: A timeboard is useful for troubleshooting and grabbing a snapshot of the systems for a certain period. The graph layout can't be customized since they're all shown together. The screenboard is more customizable and flexible for showing a high-level overview of the system. It can also incorporate widget and can be shared in real-time as a read-only.
