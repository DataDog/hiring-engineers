#Datadog hiring engineer challenge
####*By Laurent Tran - tranlaurent@hotmail.fr*

I enjoyed to do this project a lot. Cloud monitoring sounds very interesting to me. Datadog has a bright future and I hope to be part of it with you.

Please see below the 5 levels I have completed, and an additional level 6 I have enjoyed doing to try the datadog - docker countainer integration:
- [Level1](#Level1)
- [Level2](#Level2)
- [Level3](#level3)
- [Level4](#level4)
- [Level5](#level5)
- [Level6](#level6)


##Level1

*1.Signed up for Datadog*

*2.What is Datadog ?*

The **Datadog Agent **is piece of software that runs on the client's hosts. 
Its job is to faithfully **collect events and metrics** and bring them to Datadog on the client's behalf so that the client can do 
something useful with his monitoring and performance data.

The Agent has three main parts: the **collector**, the **dogstatsd**, and the **forwarder**.

The **collector** runs checks on the current machine for whatever integrations the client have and it will capture system metrics like memory and CPU.
**Dogstatsd** is a statsd backend server the client can send custom metrics to from an application.
The **forwarder** retrieves data from both dogstatsd and the collector and then queues it up to be sent to Datadog.
This is all controlled by one supervisor process. This is separate so that the client doesn't need to have the overhead of each application if the client doesn't want to run all parts.
