-- Bonus Question --

A timeboard is used to compare informations over time, it's composed of different graph, having all the same X axis of a selected lenght. A timeboard is thus used to put in parallel different metrics and to help define if there is some correlation between them.

The purpose of a screenboard is to get in one sight different informations, not necessarily connected and time-related.
It can be for instance a current value of a metric or a picture.
This kind of board is more used to share information as well, that's why it's layout can be customise.
