## Bonus question: what is the agent?

The DataDog Agent is software that runs on the clients host environment. It collects event data and metrics and sends it to DataDog. The client can then use that data to make adjustments to monitoring or performance optimization.  The data is presented in rich visual graphs which you can customize to suit your needs.
