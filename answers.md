Collecting Metrics :
 * Tags :

 * Installing the DB

 * Custom Check

 * Collection interval

 * Bonus:
Without modifying the file directly, I could switch from the CLI commands and VIM editor to the Datadog Agent GUI and tweak some things like the collection interval from there. But this would actually modify the Python file.
Else on the app.datadoghq.com/metric/summary, we have access to the metadatas of our metrics therefore we can modify the interval.
