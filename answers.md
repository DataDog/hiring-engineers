## Bonus Question - Can you change the collection interval without modifying the Python check file you created?

> Yes, it is possible to do this by creating a custom check config file for the check you've created. In my case, I created a directory at `/etc/datadog-agent/conf.d/my_check.d/`, where I stored a check file called `mycheck.yaml`. See the contents of this file below:
```
init_config:

instances:
  - min_collection_interval: 45
```
