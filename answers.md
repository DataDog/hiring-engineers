My random check script:
```python
import random
from checks import AgentCheck
class HelloCheck(AgentCheck):
    def check(self, instance):
        self.gauge('hello.world', random.randint(0, 1000))
```

**Bonus Question Can you change the collection interval without modifying the Python check file you created?**

Yes, by changing a specific setting in the config file:

Flask script setup
<img src="https://github.com/timothe/hiring-engineers/blob/solutions-engineer/Screenshot%20(20).png?raw=true">

My Flask app:

```python
from flask import Flask
import logging
import sys
import blinker as _
from ddtrace import tracer
from ddtrace.contrib.flask import TraceMiddleware

app = Flask(__name__)

traced_app = TraceMiddleware(app, tracer, service="training-flask-app", distributed_tracing=False)

# Have flask use stdout as the logger
main_logger = logging.getLogger()
main_logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
c = logging.StreamHandler(sys.stdout)
formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
c.setFormatter(formatter)
main_logger.addHandler(c)


@app.route('/')
def api_entry():
    return 'Entrypoint to the Application'

@app.route('/api/apm')
def apm_endpoint():
    return 'Getting APM Started'

@app.route('/api/trace')
def trace_endpoint():
    return 'Posting Traces'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

**Bonus Question: What is the difference between a Service and a Resource?**

A "Service" is the name of a set of processes that work together to provide a feature set. For instance, a simple web application may consist of two services: a single webapp service and a single database service, while a more complex environment may break it out into 6 services: 3 separate webapp, admin, and query services, along with a master-db, a replica-db, and a yelp-api external service.
A "Resource" is a particular query to a service. For a web application, some examples might be a canonical URL like /user/home or a handler function like ```web.user.home``` (often referred to as "routes" in MVC frameworks). For a SQL database, a resource would be the SQL of the query itself like ```select * from users where id = ?```.


## Final Question:

**Datadog has been used in a lot of creative ways in the past. Weâ€™ve written some blog posts about using Datadog to monitor the NYC Subway System, Pokemon Go, and even office restroom availability!
Is there anything creative you would use Datadog for?**

Coming from UGC, I can think of a dashboard getting information from a social network API, retrieving the number of posts with a certain hashtag, but also the number of products from a feed, and the product coverage for a given UGC set.
Then, cross-reference the product pages views with UGC to get the most popular products without UGC coverage, so that the marketing team can ask a content creator for a paid contribution.
