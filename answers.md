"""The agent is a python software installed on the server. 
The application perform checks and uploads information to the DataDog servers."""

### Level 2 - Visualizing your Data

* Since your database integration is reporting now, clone your database integration dashboard and add additional database metrics to it as well as your `test.support.random` metric from the custom Agent check.
* Bonus question: What is the difference between a timeboard and a screenboard?

""" The main difference is the data correlation between the graphs on the timeboard.""" 

* Take a snapshot of your `test.support.random` graph and draw a box around a section that shows it going above 0.90. Make sure this snapshot is sent to your email by using the @notification
