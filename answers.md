## Collecting Metrics:

* **Q1**

  To add tags, there are few methods to achieve it such as using the UI or API, though the UI and API only allow us to add tags at the host level. The remommended method is to rely on the integrations or via the configuration files. In this example, I am assigning a new tag "region:nsw" as a agent tag via configure the datadog.yaml file. Please refer to the two screenshots below.
  
  - 1.Configuration - Create a database user for the Datadog Agent:
  
    Open the datadog.yaml file and define the tag by adding "tags: region:nsw" under the "#Set the host's tags" line.
  
    **Note:** There are two forms to define tags in the configuration files, but for the datadog.yaml init file only support the "tags: key_first_tag:value_1, key_second_tag:value_2, ..." form.

  - 2.Confirmation
  
    After a few seconds, confirmed the new tag appears in the Host Map.

* **Q2**

  I installed MySQL on my Ubuntu (16.04.4) and I followed the MySQL integration page to configure MySQL and the agent. Please refer to the steps below.
  
  - 1.Configuration - Create a database user for the Datadog Agent
  
    Launch MySQL and input the command below:
  
    `mysql> CREATE USER 'datadog'@'192.168.1.5' IDENTIFIED BY 'Su27k2003';`
  
    Then verified the user was created successfully using the following commands.
   
    `mysql -u datadog --password=Su27k2003 -e "show status" | \`
    
    `grep Uptime && echo -e "\033[0;32mMySQL user - OK\033[0m" || \`
    
    `echo -e "\033[0;31mCannot connect to MySQL\033[0m"`
    
    `mysql -u datadog --password=Su27k2003 -e "show slave status" && \`
    
    `echo -e "\033[0;32mMySQL grant - OK\033[0m" || \`
    
    `echo -e "\033[0;31mMissing REPLICATION CLIENT grant\033[0m"`
   
    The Agent needs a few privileges in order to collect metrics. Grant the user the following limited privileges ONLY:
   
    `mysql> GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'datadog'@'192.168.1.5' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;`
   
    `mysql> GRANT PROCESS ON *.* TO 'datadog'@'192.168.1.5';`
   
    If enabled, metrics can be collected from the performance_schema database by granting an additional privilege:
   
    `mysql> show databases like 'performance_schema';`
    
    `mysql> GRANT SELECT ON performance_schema.* TO 'datadog'@'192.168.1.5';`
   
  - 2.Configuration - Metric Collection
   
    Added the configuration block below to the mysql.d/conf.yaml in order to start gathering the MySQL metrics:
   
    Screenshot 1: Configured /etc/datadog-agent/conf.d/mysql.d/conf.yaml

    ![](https://github.com/su27k-2003/hiring-engineers/blob/master/image/Collecting_mysql_conf.PNG)

  - 3.Configuration - Restart the agent
  
  - 4.Confirmation
  
    After configuration, I confirmed the dashboard was receiving data from MySQL. Please refer to the screenshot below.

* **Q3**

  To create a custom Agent check, I created mycheck.yaml and mycheck.py then configured the two files accordingly. Please refer to the steps and screenshots below. 
  
  - 1.Configuration - Create mycheck.yaml in conf.d directory
 
    As the custom Agent check does nothing more than sending random value for the metric my_metric, mycheck.yaml is very simple, including no real information.
 
    Screenshot 1: Created and configured /etc/datadog-agent/conf.d/mycheck.yaml

    ![](https://github.com/su27k-2003/hiring-engineers/blob/master/image/Collecting_custom_check_1.PNG)

  - 2.Configuration - Create mycheck.yaml in checks.d directory
  
    The check itself inherits from AgentCheck and send a gauge of random value for my_metric on each call. This goes in checks.d/mycheck.py:
  
    Screenshot 2: Created and configured /etc/datadog-agent/checks.d/mycheck.py

    ![](https://github.com/su27k-2003/hiring-engineers/blob/master/image/Collecting_custom_check_2.PNG)
    
  - 3.Confirmation
  
    After configuration, confirmed the 'my_metric' appeared under the Metric menu in the UI and collects data properly. Please refer to the screenshot at the first question in Visualizing Data part. 
  
  - **Note:** 
    - The names of the configuration and check files must match. If the check is called mycheck.py then the configuration file must be named mycheck.yaml.
    - Before running the custom Agent check, better to check the exceptions by running the command: `sudo /etc/init.d/datadog-agent info`. It should raise a meaningful exception if there is any improper configuration, programming error cause the check could not collect metrics.
  - References: [Datadog Docs - Writing an Agent check](https://docs.datadoghq.com/developers/agent_checks/)

* **Q4**

  I used time.sleep function in mycheck.py to make the 45 seconds time delay to data collection interval. Please refer to the screenshot below.

  Screenshot: Added time delay function into the /etc/datadog-agent/checks.d/mycheck.py

  ![](https://github.com/su27k-2003/hiring-engineers/blob/master/image/Collecting_custom_check_3.PNG)

* **Bonus Question**

  We also could change the data collection interval by configuring min_collection_interval in the mycheck.yaml file. Please refer to the screenshot below.

  Screenshot: Added min_collection_interval to the /etc/datadog-agent/conf.d/mycheck.yaml

## Visualizing Data:

* **Q1**

  I created a timeboard which collected data of the custom metric: my_metric just created in the previous step by running the Python code below. Please refer to the steps below for detailed information.

  - 1.Check authentication - API and APP keys
  
    As all requests to Datadogâ€™s API must be authenticated, we should confirm the API and APP keys first. Requests that write data require reporting access and require an API key. Requests that read data require full access and also require an application key. The API and APP keys could be found at https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#api. 
    
  - 2.Create a Timeboard via Datadog API
  
    There are few ways to submitting Datadog API such as using Curl or Python/Ruby code. 
     
    The "How to" page in the Docs gave me lots of useful information about how to use the Datadog API and I just need to copy the source code from the Docs and modify it accordingly. In this case, I changed the title of the Timeboard to "Show my_metric" and the name of the graph to "My Metric (custom metric)". The most important thing is modifying the "requests" part in "graphs" to add the metric: "my_metric" to the Timeboard.

    Python code: /code/Create_timeboard.py

    ```python
    from datadog import initialize, api

    options = {
        'api_key': '5032023d686e6bd9b5e0b376a59bb27f',
        'app_key': '94846c5a071f7c2dc77381214fed18614987250a'
    }

    initialize(**options)


    # Create a new Timeboard
    title = "Show my_metric"
    description = "For the home challenge"
    graphs = [{
        "definition": {
            "events": [],
            "viz": "timeseries",
            "requests": [
                {"q": "my_metric{host:deep-learning-virtual-machine}",
                "type": "line",
                "style": {
                    "palette": "dog_classic",
                    "type": "solid",
                    "width": "normal"},
                "conditional_formats": [],
                "aggregator": "avg"
                },
            ],
        },
        "title": "My Metric (custom metric)"
    }]

    template_variables = [{
        "name": "host1",
        "prefix": "host",
        "default": "host:my-host"
    }]

    read_only = True

    try:
        api.Timeboard.create(title=title,
                                description=description,
                                graphs=graphs,
                                template_variables=template_variables,
                                read_only=read_only)
    except:
        print 'Error occurred!'
    else:
        print 'Sent API request successfully.'

    '''
    
    
  - 3.Confirmation
  
    - The Datadog API uses HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of a request. An error indicates that the service did not successfully handle user's request. The explanation of status codes can be found at https://docs.datadoghq.com/api/?lang=python#success-and-errors.
    
      **Note**: When using libraries, some errors may throw exceptions rather than return JSON objects, so better to use exception in the code to handle errors.  
    
    - I confirmed the timeboard worked as expected. Please refer to the screenshot below.

* **Q2**

  I randomly picked mysql.net.connections as the metric to apply anomaly function (https://docs.datadoghq.com/monitors/monitor_types/anomaly/). Unfortunately, I couldn't find the way to add the mysql.net.connections metric to the timeboard I just created in the last step. It seems the anomaly function only could apply to the monitor so I created a monitor instead of timeboard in this step. Please refer to the screenshot and the Python code below. If I missed something, please point me to the right direction and let me know. Thank you.

```


* **Q3**

  This page (https://docs.datadoghq.com/graphing/miscellaneous/functions/#rollup-1) guided me on how to use rollup function to sum up data and I applied it to the custom metric (my_metric) from the host:deep-learning-virtual-machine. Please refer to the screenshot and the Python code below.

* **Bonus Question**

  We use Anomaly Detection to identify when a metric is behaving differently to it has in the past, taking into account trends, seasonal day-of-week and time-of-day patterns. From the graph below we can see the algorithm is monitoring historical data to calculate the metricâ€™s expected normal range of behaviour.

## Collecting APM Data:

* **Bonus Question**

  Service is a set of processes that do the same job. For instance, a simple web application may consist of two services: a single webapp service and a single database service.
  
  Resource is a particular action for a service. For a web application: some examples might be a canonical URL, such as /user/home or a handler function like web.user.home. For a SQL database: a resource is the query itself, such as SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?.

* **Q1**

  Please refer to the link and the screenshot below:

## Final Question:

 Iâ€™m very interested in IoT and I have developed a few Raspberry Pi based home automation projects such as smart garage door (Demo: https://youtu.be/OaJwVSyagKI) and home security camera. Iâ€™m aiming to build a smart home by myself as it could make life easier for my family and improve my technical skills.

 While developing these projects, I found a few pain points and I think Datadog could help me to resolve/improve it.

 * Analysing issues

 For example, on the smart garage door project sometimes I found the smart garage door system did not work properly for some reason. The issue could be a communication issue between my phone and the Raspberry Pi (HTTP sending/receiving) or bugs in the script I developed and even the Raspberry Pi itself. Usually itâ€™s not easy to figure out the root cause so I spent a lot of time on troubleshooting and debugging and found a way to determine and fix issues by sending out notification from each function in the system to trace which part caused the issue.
 Now, I could create a dashboard in Datadog which include Infrastructure Metrics of Raspberry Pi and APM for the Flask application I developed, those data could help me to understand the current system state easily also allow me to quickly determine which part of the system didn't function when issue occurred. For example, if I still could receive those infrastructure metrics data from the Raspberry Pi but the APM didn't show the proper data I would check any potential communication issues such as the mobile data function had been turned off in my phone. If it wasn't a communication issue then I would look into the Flask as the next step to find the root cause.  
               
 * Integrate separate data into a single smart home system monitor

 There are a few smart home projects Iâ€™m running at home and different project generates their own data in different UI. For example, I have to check room temperature by ssh to the Raspberry Pi remotely every time and use VNC to access the Raspberry Pi if I need to check the security camera video. 
I believe that I can send these data to Datadog and integrate them into a single smart home system dashboard which includes all data I need to improve system visibility and make my life easier.
Unfortunately, I cannot provide a demo and show the possibility of Datadog could bring to me as it needs some time to complete but I will find some time to achieve this and share it with you.
