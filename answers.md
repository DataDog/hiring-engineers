### Level 1 - Collecting your Data

What is the agent?

At the risk of anthropomorphizing, the Agent is DataDog's local representative residing on the Client's Host. A program which collects data and metrics concerning the state and activities of the host and sends that information to DataDog. In turn, DataDog is able to process and present that information back to the Client.
