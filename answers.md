# Prerequisites

To begin this exercise, I had to choose an appropriate environment to model Datadogâ€™s functionality that's feasible within the confines of my Chromebook running ChromeOS. I opted to dual-boot my machine to run [GalliumOS](https://galliumos.org/), a lightweight Linux distribution based on Xubuntu, partitioned alongside the ChromeOS. From my new VM, I was easily able to sign up for Datadog and begin running the agent.
