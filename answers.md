# Jason Jakary, Sales Engineer Candidate
### September, 2021


## Overview
This was a fun exercize that gave me a much better under-the-hood look at Datadog than what I was able to research with an interest and the [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPO2QgTCReBAThZca6MB9jg). For the sake of clearity and brivity, I've organized this document to mirror the exercize readme. 

### Why work at Datadog?
In a sentence, working here as an SE means an opportunity to merge my technical, people, and business backgrounds to work with cool software I personally use and help to teach more people about it. I was originally looking for a monitoring and analytics platform for my homelab when I discoverd that not only does Datadog seem the solution on this front, but that there's an SE opening in Denver. Having just completed my MBA, I'm actively searching for SE positions to put that business education to use. My fiancee and I are also planning to move to Denver in the coming months. After having conversations with Amanda and Jake, the company atmosphere seems fantastic. I'd love to work with you all and look forward to meeting you, pending review of this document.
