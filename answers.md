### Prerequisites - Setup the environment

- For this challenge I used my local machine as the host for the datadog agent. My OS is the macOS High Sierra Version 10.13.6
- I followed the prompt, signed up for a free trial at https://www.datadoghq.com/, and used the Mac OS installation instructions

> As a backup plan for if I ran into any OS/dependency issues I also installed a VM using Vagrant.

### Collecting Metrics

The next step was to add some custom tags to the Agent config file.

- I navigated to the agent config file at /etc/datadog-agent/datadog.yaml. Here is a screen shot of the custom tags I added to the config file:
