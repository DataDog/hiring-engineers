## Prerequisites - Setup the environment
I started the project by spinning up a ubuntu 16.04 linux box using vagrant. The specific box that I used was "https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/xenial/current/xenial-server-cloudimg-amd64-vagrant.box" which I found on vagrantbox.es. Originally I tried to create my own vm using virtualbox but I was having trouble with the datadog agent integration. Once I switched over to the vagrant box the datadog agent integration went smoothly.
