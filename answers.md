## Overview

This answers.md file only contains the aswers to the challenges itself. The goal here is to me the more objective as possible, only pointing to screenshots and dashboards.

## Collecting Metrics:

* Add tags in the Agent config file and show us a screenshot of your host and its tags on the Host Map page in Datadog.

* Install a database on your machine (MongoDB, MySQL, or PostgreSQL) and then install the respective Datadog integration for that database.

* Create a custom Agent check that submits a metric named my_metric with a random value between 0 and 1000.

* Change your check's collection interval so that it only submits the metric once every 45 seconds.

* **Bonus Question** Can you change the collection interval without modifying the Python check file you created?

	**Answer: You can just change the .yaml file, adding the option min_collection_interval, without touching the Python file.**

## Visualizing Data:

Dashboard Requested:

* **Bonus Question**: What is the Anomaly graph displaying?
**Answer: It's displaying the metric mysql.performance.com_select, which shows the rate of select statements, if there is any kind of anomaly, the graph will show it.**

## Monitoring Data

https://app.datadoghq.com/monitors/33419785
 * **Bonus Question**: Since this monitor is going to alert pretty often, you donâ€™t want to be alerted when you are out of the office. Set up two scheduled downtimes for this monitor:
 * One that silences it from 7pm to 9am daily on M-F

 * And one that silences it all day on Sat-Sun

 - Make sure that your email is notified when you schedule the downtime
   and take a screenshot of that notification

## Collecting APM Data:

 * **Bonus Question**: What is the difference between a Service and a Resource?
Answer: Resource is an unique resource into an application, it can be a request, a view, a page, an image, anything that an application can process. Service is the grouping of various resources into the same application context.

Provide a link and a screenshot of a Dashboard with both APM and Infrastructure Metrics.

## Final Question:
Is there anything creative you would use Datadog for?

Datadog gives us the possibility to basically monitor any asset that comes to mind. Whether it is a cryptocurrency monitoring farm, IoT devices such as smartbands, in short, there is no possible limit to creativity. I have already used Datadog in personal projects where I needed to use Forecast to detect some Covid situations in 2020, as well as I used it to measure the bandwidth usage of my devices at my home.

3 ultra creative and hypothetical situations that I would use the Datadog, would be:

1 - The first one would be to use in some way to find the winning numbers of the lottery. (Just kidding, we know that mathematically doesn't work).

2 - Secondly, if I could teleport in time, I would use Datadog to monitor my favorite game, which was Ragnarok Online in the middle of 2006 and to avoid several problems and create several improvements.

3 - And nowadays, I could use Datadog to monitor some Arduino and ESP32 projects that I have for sound automation with my digital piano and message exchange via MIDI.
