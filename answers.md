* The Datadog Agent runs on a host to collect metrics and events. This information is sent to Datadog where you can use the information in a number of ways. There are three components to the Agent - the collector, Dogstatsd, and forwarder. The collector runs with the installed integrations and captures system metrics. Dogstatsd is a statsd daemon used for sending metrics from an application. The forwarder queues and sends data from the collector and Dogstatsd to Datadog.
