* Bonus question: In your own words, what is the Agent?

The datadog agent is a typical daemon program.  It runs as a small program behind a target system called Integration/s.  The major purpose of the program is collectiong and sending system information to your datadog system in a cloud service which is hosted by Datadog.　　The strong differentiator is its extensibility.  You can define new metrics as you needed, and also using tags, you can get very various types of reports(called dashboard) for your daily operation.  Other merit is its easiness.  The steps to integrate other services is almost automated, or pre-defined.  You can install an agent with pre-defined manner to reduce opeartion cost.
