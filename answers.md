**Section I: Collecting Metrics**

Add tags in the Agent config file and show us a screenshot of your host and its tags on the Host Map page in Datadog.**
My host tags can be seen here: https://la-psql-zebra.s3.amazonaws.com/host_tags.PNG

I choose to install PostgreSQL and installed the Datadog integration for Postgres. This can be verified in Section II by viewing my dashboard. 
Here is my_metric.py https://github.com/ekufta0530/hiring-engineers/blob/master/my_metric.py
```python
import random
import datadog_checks.base import AgentCheck

class MyCheck(AgentCheck):
      def check(self, instance):
              self.gauge('my_metric', random.randint(0, 1000))
```

...
min_collection_interval: 45. 
...

**Section II: Visualizing Data**
