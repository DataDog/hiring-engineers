### Bonus question: What is the difference between a timeboard and a screenboard?
>Timeboards are time-synchronized with an automatic layout. That is, all graphs will appear equal size and on the same time scale. This is mainly used for troubleshooting and correlation. Screenboards, on the other hand, are more flexible and customizable. These can include widgets and graphs of different sizes and timeframes. It utilizes a drag-and-drop style to help the user develop a custom view on their system.
