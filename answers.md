### Prerequisites - Setting up the Environment

My Datadog environment setup includes an agent install on my laptop Windows OS and a Linux VM via Vagrant. The directions mention that any OS can be used, but I didn't want to necessarily skip a recommendation. I had never used Vagrant up until this point either, so I was interested in the challenge. (It was certainly also a backup in case I really did run into dependency issues--best to be prepared!) 

Once I was able to validate that tags were being populated after a config edit in the VM, I proceeded through the rest of the assessment on my Windows OS.
