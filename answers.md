Collecting Metrics :
 * Tags :

 * Installing the DB

 * Custom Check

 * Collection interval

 * Bonus:
Without modifying the file directly, I could switch from the CLI commands and VIM editor to the Datadog Agent GUI and tweak some things like the collection interval from there. But this would actually modify the Python file.
Else on the app.datadoghq.com/metric/summary, we have access to the metadatas of our metrics therefore we can modify the interval.


Visualizing Data:
 - Screens of Custom Metric ScopeD / MySql Metric with Anomaly Function / CustMetr with RollUp
 - Print Script

 * Timeboard's timeframe to past 5 minutes => Not found

 * Snapshot of graph (Mail and all)

 * Bonus:
The MySql Performance CPU with Anomaly Detection graph is displaying what is normal - the greyed area - and what is not - the red flagged points outside of this greyed area. The greyed area shows a trend of what should be next and by such detects what should not be: strange checks that are way too high or way too low.
