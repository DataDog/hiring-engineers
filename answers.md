### Level 0 (optional) - Setup an Ubuntu VM

Let's run it in a Google Cloud Platform and test other integrations. Should we?

### Level 1 - Collecting your Data

* Sign up for Datadog (use "Datadog Recruiting Candidate" in the "Company" field), get the Agent reporting metrics from your local machine.

It's alive!

* Bonus question: In your own words, what is the Agent?

The agent is a python software installed on the server. 
The application perform checks and uploads collected information.

### Level 2 - Visualizing your Data

* Since your database integration is reporting now, clone your database integration dashboard and add additional database metrics to it as well as your `test.support.random` metric from the custom Agent check.

* Take a snapshot of your `test.support.random` graph and draw a box around a section that shows it going above 0.90. Make sure this snapshot is sent to your email by using the @notification

It's reporting. This was taken late, after I did all other work, but hey. It's here!

* Bonus question: What is the difference between a timeboard and a screenboard?

The main difference is the data correlation between the graphs on the timeboard. 

### Level 3 - Alerting on your Data

#### The Alert game is on!

#### Oh. I need to go to sleep know. Stop. Bothering. Me. ( And I have work to do. Let's make it a bit longer one Ok? ).

### Bonus level. I really like that timeboard!

My concern. Since I see the events on the graph, I want to corelate them easier. Give me hover infomration please!

### Links here and there

ScreenBoard: https://p.datadoghq.com/sb/1355100ed-04da0b7178

it's a good platform and I'm sure I can graph more here. Can't wait to add my thermostat and power usage from the outlets ;-)
