# Prerequisites

To begin this exercise, I had to choose an appropriate environment to model Datadogâ€™s functionality that's feasible within the confines of my Chromebook running ChromeOS. I opted to dual-boot my machine to run [GalliumOS](https://galliumos.org/), a lightweight Linux distribution based on Xubuntu, partitioned alongside the ChromeOS. From my new VM, I was easily able to sign up for Datadog and begin running the agent.  

# Collecting Metrics 
Next, I added the below tags into the tags section of my agent configuration file to add some more details on my machine.

```
## @param tags  - list of key:value elements - optional
## List of host tags. Attached in-app to every metric, event, log, trace, and service check emitted by this Agent.
##
## Learn more about tagging: https://docs.datadoghq.com/tagging/
#
tags:
   - environment:dev
   - chassis:desktop
   - os:galliumos3.1
   - kernel:linux4.16.18
```

Here is my host, named `katelyn.localhost`, and its tags, shown bottom right, on the Host Map page in DataDog.

Then I opted to download a PostgreSQL database on my machine and install the corresponding Datadog integration to begin collecting those metrics and logs.  After creating user `datadog` and granting the role `pg_monitor` to that user,  here is a verification of the correct permissioning on my PostgreSQL database:

To make this integration more meaningful, I wanted to allow for metric collection and log integration.  To do so, I altered my `postgres.d/conf.yaml` configuration file to point to my host/port and configure logging, shown here:

and altered my machine's `postgresql.conf` file to configure logging, shown here:

The output of a call to `sudo datadog-agent status`, shown below, verifies that the PostgreSQL integration and logging is functioning.
