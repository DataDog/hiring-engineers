My answers to the questions are here.


Level 1
  Bonus question: In your own words, what is the Agent? 
    The agent is a flexible piece of software installed on the host that facilitates communication between the device being monitored and the datadog instance. It collects and sends out-of-the-box metrics and alerts and can be quickly configured to send custom metrics from applications.
  
Level 2
  Bonus question: What is the difference between a timeboard and a screenboard?
    Timeboard's graphs are always scoped to the same time and can be shared individually. They are generally used for correlation and troubleshooting.
    Screenboards provide a compilation of multiple graphs and each graph can have a unique timeframe. They are more flexible and customizable which can allow for a high-level 360 degree view of the system. Screenboards can be shared as a whole and/or as read-only.
