Bonus Question: In your own words, what is the Agent?
   The agent is effectively a daemon that fills several
   rolls. It is somewhat similar to an http daemon (httpd) 
   like apache, but is much more specific in that it only
   connects and serves information to a specified site, or
   sites. The central purpose of the agent
   is to monitor other long-running processes while collecting
   data and serving it to a centralized location, on which
   the data can be compiled with data served by other agents
   to build a picture of one's infrastructure.
