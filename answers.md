*Can you change the collection interval without modifying the Python check file you created?*
Yes, using the YAML configuration file

*Please be sure, when submitting your hiring challenge, to include the script that you've used to create this Timeboard.*
The script, also present in the file `timeboard.sh`, is made using curl:

```
curl -X POST "https://api.datadoghq.eu/api/v1/dashboard" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "DD-API-KEY: ${DD_API_KEY}" \
-H "DD-APPLICATION-KEY: ${DD_APP_KEY}" \

*What is the Anomaly graph displaying?*
The anomaly graph is displaying a confidence interval indicating the expected range in which a data is considered generated by the process monitored in its "normal" mode.

*When this monitor sends you an email notification, take a screenshot of the email that it sends you.*

*Make sure that your email is notified when you schedule the downtime and take a screenshot of that notification.*

*What is the difference between a Service and a Resource?*
A service will perform an action / is akin to a function call whereas a resource is object-like, like some data to retrieve.

*Provide a link and a screenshot of a Dashboard with both APM and Infrastructure Metrics.*

*Datadog has been used in a lot of creative ways in the past. Weâ€™ve written some blog posts about using Datadog to monitor the NYC Subway System, Pokemon Go, and even office restroom availability!
Is there anything creative you would use Datadog for?*

May be I could try using Datadog to monitor some connected utilities: a smart TV and its usage, a fridge to monitor my eating tendencies or a enterprise coffee machine to know if its working.
