# Stig's answers

Hey Datadogs - my name is Stig and I've had he pleasure of going through your hiring exercice. 
These are my answers, screenshots and links - enjoy :)

## Pre-reqs
FYI - I chose to use my private MacBook. First of all because I was curious about what the agent is able to pull our of it. And secondly I was too lazy to set up the vagrant and virtualbox stuff to get my environment running. 
So - my private Mac is what you'll see. It is rather old as well, so this should be a great challenge :)

## Collecting metrics
I added 2 screenshots here. One is my Hostmap after installing the initial agent, postgres, the integration and adding the tags (agent and user). In the second one (no bonuspoints expected!) I played with the grouping. It doesn't make too much sense when only monitoring one host, but it adds some context to the map (which I like).
Not sure if you can access my Datadog user, but added the links as well (just in case)
