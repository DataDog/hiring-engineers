Final Question:
Datadog has been used in a lot of creative ways in the past. Weâ€™ve written some blog posts about using Datadog to monitor the NYC Subway System, Pokemon Go, and even office restroom availability!

TASK #17: Is there anything creative you would use Datadog for?

ANSWER #17:

There are many different solutions in the market that are able to find current and historical problems but there might be less thathave good insight to find hidden or yet-to-be-seen issues.

By leveraging on machine learning technology with some anomaly detection and forecasting analysis and go deeper with events/logs correlation across hyrid infrasture and application, DataDog should be able to solve complex application and infrastructure issues.

Apart from that, in most cases, some people will still ask "what else can you do?"
If DataDog could alwyas adopt fast enough to the common trend using its platform and framework, it should bring significant values to everyone.

These are some sample interesting business cases:

- Can I analyze my revenue generating application with DataDog platform, if I see a burst in sales numbers, can I see the pattern and repeat the success?
- On the other hand, if I see my sales is declining every day, how do I prevent it not to go down further?

Technical use cases:
- I would to monitor and plan my users, customers, infrastructure growth in general.
- I would to provide analytical feedback to the devops team, where people spend most of the time in the application or where they spend much less time.
