TASK #16:
Bonus Question: What is the difference between a Service and a Resource?

ANSWER #16: 
A Service is a set of application processes that run together for the same purpose. It is developed, deployed, managed and maintained for specific business application. Performance of a service shows high level application health e.g: total request, total error, overall application latency

A Resource is an activity that run on a single service. A single service can run a span of resources.
The performance of a resource represents closely to the problem with detail information, e.g: with the high latency that happening, what activity that causing it.
