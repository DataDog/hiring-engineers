    details: |-
      The forwarded ports for the machine are listed below. Please note that
      these values may differ from values configured in the Vagrantfile if the
      provider supports automatic port collision detection and resolution.
    empty_ports: |-
      The provider reported there are no forwarded ports for this virtual
      machine. This can be caused if there are no ports specified in the
      Vagrantfile or if the virtual machine is not currently running. Please
      check that the virtual machine is running and try again.
    missing_capability: |-
      The %{provider} provider does not support listing forwarded ports. This is
      most likely a limitation of the provider and not a bug in Vagrant. If you
      believe this is a bug in Vagrant, please search existing issues before
      opening a new one.
    no_matching_port: |-
      The guest is not currently mapping port %{port} to the host machine. Is
      the port configured in the Vagrantfile? You may need to run `vagrant reload`
      if changes were made to the port configuration in the Vagrantfile.
