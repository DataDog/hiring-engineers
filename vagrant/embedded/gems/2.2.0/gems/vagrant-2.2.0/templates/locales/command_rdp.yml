      Vagrant will now launch your RDP client with the connection parameters
      above. If the connection fails, verify that the information above is
      correct. Additionally, make sure the RDP server is configured and
      running in the guest machine (it is disabled by default on Windows).
      Also, verify that the firewall is open to allow RDP connections.

    errors:
      host_unsupported: |-
        Vagrant doesn't support running an RDP client on your
        host OS.

        If you wish for the OS you're running to support launching
        an RDP client, please contribute this functionality back
        into Vagrant. At the very least, open an issue on how it
        could be done and we can handle the integration.
      rdp_undetected: |-
        RDP connection information for this machine could not be
        detected. This is typically caused when we can't find the IP
        or port to connect to for RDP. Please verify you're forwarding
        an RDP port and that your machine is accessible.
