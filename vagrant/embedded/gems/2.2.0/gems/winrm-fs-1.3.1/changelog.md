# 0.4.2
- Improved Powershell error handling in metadata checking.

# 0.4.1
- Fixes a regression on Windows 2008 R2/Windows 7 and below where the WinRM service corrupts the check files metadata resulting in malformed destination paths.

# 0.4.0
- Correct the destination path of individual files. Always assume it is the full destination path unless it is an existing directory. This may potentialy break some callers expecting the remote path to be a directory that winrm-fs will create if missing as the destination of the local file. A new directory will not be created and the local file will be uploaded directly to the remote path.

# 0.3.2
- Fix re-extraction of cached directories from temp folder when there is more than one "clean" directory deleted from destination

# 0.3.1
- Widen logging version constraints to include 2.0 (matching WinRM core gem)

# 0.3.0
- Jetisons `CommandExecutor` now living in the core WinRM gem and swaps in implementation currently used in the winrm-transport gem. These changes should have little visible effect on current consumers of the `FileManager` class with these exceptions:
  - BREAKING CHANGE: When uploading a directory and the destination directory exists on the endpoint, the source base directory will be created below the destination directory on the endpoint and the source directory contents will be unzipped to that location. Prior to this release, the contents of the source directory would be unzipped to an existing destination directory without creating the source base directory. This new behavior is more consistent with SCP and other well known shell copy commands.
  - `Upload` may now receive an array of source files and directories rather than just a single file or directory path.

- Add zip file creation debug logging.

- Simplified file manager upload method API to take only a single source file or directory
- Expanded acceptable username and hostnames for rwinrmcp

# 0.1.0
