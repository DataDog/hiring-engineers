This document introduces interested developers to log4r development. It also
reminds us how things work here. :-)

RubyForge Site
--------------

Log4r is hosted on RubyForge. It was hosted on SourceForge up to 1.0.5.

Project Full Name:  Log4r
Project Unix Name:  log4r
CVS Server:         cvs.log4r.rubyforge.org
Shell/Web Server:   log4r.rubyforge.org
Path to web pages:  /var/www/gforge-projects/log4r/


HTML manual and site
--------------------

This is pieced together with a homebrewed content-template system. 
doc/content has the actual contents, which are just three lines of metadata 
and a bunch of <tr>s that are incorporated into a template. The only template 
is doc/templates/main.html which is universal. To test the changes, run 
bin/makedoc.rb directly and check the results in doc/index.html.


Testing RDoc
------------
Either run bin/makerdoc.rb directly or,

  cd lib/
  rdoc --op /tmp/rdoc --template kilmer --main log4r.rb


Automated Builds
----------------

The build system is automated and relies on CVS and ruby. There are three main
things that go on during build:

1) bin/makedist.rb checks out a build to prepare for distribution and calls
   other build scripts, then assembles the distribution into tgz and zip balls

2) HTML manual is constructed by bin/makehtml.rb, called from makedist.rb

3) RDoc is constructed by bin/makerdoc.rb, called from makedist.rb

All system variables and configurable options are in bin/devconfig.rb.

Essentially, the only thing that needs to be done to build packages for
distribution is,

  ruby makedist.rb <version-number>

The results are one tarball, one zip file of the same, and one documentation
tarball ready to be placed on the log4r home page.
