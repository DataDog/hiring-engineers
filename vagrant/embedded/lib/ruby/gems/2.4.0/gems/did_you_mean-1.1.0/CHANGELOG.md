## [v1.0.2](https://github.com/yuki24/did_you_mean/tree/v1.0.2)

_<sup>released on 2016-06-20 18:03:07 UTC</sup>_

#### Features

- Experimental features are officially available through `require 'did_you_mean/experimental'`

#### Deprecations

- `require 'did_you_mean/extra_features'` is now deprecated in favor of `require 'did_you_mean/experimental'`

#### Internal Changes

- Replaced the `DidYouMean::SpellCheckable` module with the `DidYouMean::SpellChecker` class. This is a slower implementation but close to the model explained in [this talk](https://speakerdeck.com/yuki24/saving-people-from-typos), more reusable and possibly makes it easier to expose the class as a public interface.
