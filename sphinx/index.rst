Introduction

Hi Datadog Team!

I have created this documentation site through Sphinx to show the steps I've taken to complete this technical challenge.

During the first week of the project, I used the time to learn as much as I could about the Datadog agent and platform so I could best implement the software on a bare VM.

During the second week of the project, I took my time to thoroughly go through each step and understand exactly what I was implementing.

This technical challenge was fun and something I looked forward to each day for the last two weeks. It was a perfect way to get to know the software and what Datadog has to offer to its' customers.

Thank you for your consideration and I look forward to more opportunity with Datadog!
