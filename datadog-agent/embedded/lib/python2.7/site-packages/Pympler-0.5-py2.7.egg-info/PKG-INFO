Description: 
        Pympler is a development tool to measure, monitor and analyze the
        memory behavior of Python objects in a running Python application.
        
        By pympling a Python application, detailed insight in the size and
        the lifetime of Python objects can be obtained.  Undesirable or
        unexpected runtime behavior like memory bloat and other "pymples"
        can easily be identified.
        
        Pympler integrates three previously separate projects into a single,
        comprehensive profiling tool. Asizeof provides basic size information
        for one or several Python objects, muppy is used for on-line
        monitoring of a Python application and the class tracker provides
        off-line analysis of the lifetime of selected Python objects. A
        web profiling frontend exposes process statistics, garbage
        visualisation and class tracker statistics.
        
        Pympler is written entirely in Python, with no dependencies to
        external libraries. It has been tested with Python 2.6, 2.7,
        3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 on Linux, Windows and MacOS X.
