# If you need a proxy to connect to the Internet, provide it here (default:
# disabled). You can use the 'no_proxy' list to specify hosts that should
# bypass the proxy. These settings might impact your checks requests, please
# refer to the specific check documentation for more details. Environment
# variables DD_PROXY_HTTP, DD_PROXY_HTTPS and DD_PROXY_NO_PROXY (space-separated string)
# will override the values set here. See https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/proxy/.
#
# proxy:
#   http: http://user:password@proxy_for_http:port
#   https: http://user:password@proxy_for_https:port
#   no_proxy:
#     - host1
#     - host2

# Setting this option to "yes" will tell the agent to skip validation of SSL/TLS certificates.
# This may be necessary if the agent is running behind a proxy. See this page for details:
# https://github.com/DataDog/dd-agent/wiki/Proxy-Configuration#using-haproxy-as-a-proxy
# skip_ssl_validation: no

# Setting this option to "yes" will force the agent to only use TLS 1.2 when
# pushing data to the url specified in "dd_url".
# force_tls_12: no

# Force the hostname to whatever you want. (default: auto-detected)
# hostname: mymachine.mydomain

# Make the agent use "hostname -f" on unix-based systems as a last resort
# way of determining the hostname instead of Golang "os.Hostname()"
# This will be enabled by default in version 6.4
# More information at  https://dtdg.co/flag-hostname-fqdn
# hostname_fqdn: false

# Set the host's tags (optional)
