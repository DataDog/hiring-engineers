# The Challenge

## Questions

### Level 1

* Sign up for Datadog, get the agent reporting metrics from your local machine. Bonus question: what is the agent?
* Submit an event via the API.
* Get an event to appear in your email inbox (the email address you signed up for the account with)

### Level 2

* Take a simple web app ([in any of our supported languages](http://docs.datadoghq.com/libraries/)) that you've already built and instrument your code with dogstatsd.
* While running a load test for a few minutes, visualize page views per second. Send us the link to this graph!
* Create a histogram to see the latency; also give us the link to the graph
* Bonus points for putting together more creative dashboards.

If you need a tool to load-test your web app you can use tools like:
* [ab](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/programs/ab.html)
* [tsung](http://tsung.erlang-projects.org/user_manual.html#htoc2)
