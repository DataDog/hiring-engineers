# Steffen's answers

Hi<br>
my name is Steffen and I had fun runnning through this exercise.<br>

# Environment
I have attached my home automation instance on a raspberry. There is no
binding for my Openhab installation, so I also tried to use home assistant
to transmit Smart Home information. In addition I added some data feeds via APIs<br>

## Collecting metrics
The screenshots show the hostmap after installing the agent to my Raspberry.



#My comments

I liked the structure of the datadog.conf file. All default values have been entered and
umcommented like <br>```# enable_gohai: true```
